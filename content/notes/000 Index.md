**Concepts start with C**
Using name starting with C (not UID)
(concepts/ideas)
==What can be classified as 'C'?== Sometimes the lines are blurry
- Should not be **industries, companies, countries, religions, items** etc â†’ ==These are '**2_**'==. Should be "==**concepts and ideas**==".

# A rough idea of how this should work
###### The process
0. Do the documentation of books and articles as per normal as I have always done in notion/notebook
- Books and articles should go into the respective **folders**

**BUT** 

1. Concepts/standalone ideas get zettelled (with the UID)
	There are two layers: 
	- link to individual zettels
	- tags
	refer to this: [[Some Thoughts on How to Keep a Zettelkasten]]
	also refer to this: [[A_In what ways can we form useful relationships between notes [LONG READ]|relationships between notes]]
2. Try to link whatever I read to any of these zettels
