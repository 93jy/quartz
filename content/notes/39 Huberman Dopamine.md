- “Dopamine is a currency and it’s the way that you track pleasure, track success, track whether or not you are doing well or poorly.”
- Learn to **spike dopamine from *effort* itself**: focusing only on the *reward* at the end of effort can undermine the process, making the process feel more painful and time feel longer
	- Accessing reward from the **process**: associate dopamine release from **friction and challenge** you are in during effort instead of only once goal is achieved – convince yourself the **effort part is the good part** (e.g., intermittent fasting)
