- Metrics are statistics, so their usefulness depends in large part on the narrative around them 
	- Some argue that divestment causes no real-world reduction in emissions. So a divestment-focused investor's narrative is important if It is to show how it has reduced risk. This can help avoid [greenwashing](notes/C_Greenwashing.md) accusations
	- Using metrics that cover different areas of **[stewardship](notes/C_Stewardship.md)** can also help investors avoid greenwashing 
- Different metrics have different use cases 
	- **Forward**-looking metrics: aspirational, help us understand potential risks
	- **Historic** metrics: assess where we are and what our direction of travel is 
## Examples of metrics 
- PD: proportion of portfolio with emissions data 
	- How much do we know of the portfolio?
- NCE: number of companies engaged with 
	- Whether an investor/manager is genuinely interested in change
- CF: carbon footprint - a portfolio's proportionate share of measured or estimated emissions from holdings 
	- Assessing real-world emissions from a portfolio 
- Emissions intensity
	- Carbon content for each unit of measure (e.g. profit / revenue)
- CVAR: climate value at risk 
	- Forward-looking, gives a sense of risk exposure
- ITR: implied temperature rise - what sort of increase in temperature the portfolio may be considered to be supporting 
	- For showing an investor's 'personal' alignment with Paris goals 
- REALTH: reduction in emissions (absolute) from long-term holdings
	- Assessing real-world reduction of emissions from companies in a portfolio
