*Very good article with a lot of new concepts to understand*
- 2 distinct types of ESG: 
	- Green, social and sustainability lending (GSS) (more established)
	- Sustainability-linked lending (SLL) - more flexible (so higher volumes), but could lead to accusations of [C_Greenwashing](notes/C_Greenwashing.md)
- How SLLs work 
	- Cost of borrowing depends on performance measured against specific sustainability performance targets (SPTs) e.g. greenhouse gas emission reduction 
	- Economic incentive: ratchet on the margin. Increase (malus) in the coupon if SPT not met / bonus (reduced margin) if met
	- Malus: perverse [[2_Incentives|incentive]] where the lender benefits if SPT is not met. To solve: lender commits to pay this malus amount to a sustainability project / charity, so there is ESG benefit regardless of whether target fulfilled 
- Is this a panacea? 
	- **KPI**: Is an SPT sufficiently ambitious, material, transparent or rigorously evaluated? Do the KPIs truly address the core issues facing the industry? 
	- **Standardisation**: not yet, still a fledging market; could lead to [[C_Greenwashing]] (credibility risk)
	- [[Sustainability reporting]]: SFDR - need scientifically measurable sustainability targets 
- **When used properly, it can align [[2_Incentives|incentives]]** between borrowers and lenders to provide an additional route by which investors can engage with companies
