- Why the public offer size is so huge
	- Usually, big debt offerings target HNW and institutional investors. Private placement takes up the bulk of the issue, then retail investors get the scraps. Here it's the opposite 
	- The company is using the institutional tranche mainly for **bookbuilding (to determine price)** and give the bulk to retail. 2 possible reasons 
		- Being nice to retail investors 
		- No demand from institutional investors. *Institutional liquidity is drying up globally with tightening [2_Monetary policy](notes/2_Monetary%20policy.md)*. 
- Price benchmarking
	- 1.4% yield spread against 10-year SGS, or 1.5% yield spread against 5-year SGS 
	- Average yield spread for investment grade bonds (US) ~1.5%
- Will interest rates go up? 
	- This is locking in 5 years at this yield; if want to sell at market price, could make capital losses as interest rates go up 
- Credit / default risk 
	- Not backed by Temasek, but by Thai billionaire (so risk is not zero like Temasek bond / SGS)
	- On top of macro risk (the main risk for Astrea), also taking on single issuer risk (that atmething goes wrong with Frasers Property)
- **Bond investors are different from equity investors: they only care about solvency**
	- Bond investors don't care about how well a company does. So **equity investors are narrative driven** (how the companies will grow to new heights), while **bond investors only care if company can repay the debt**
	- 'Because of that bond investors *spend a lot of time looking at financial statements*, which of course is *a skill many investors have lost after a decade of Fed fueled liquidity*.'
- Frasers Property financial statements 
	- P&L 
		- Property developers could have lumpy earnings because of how property sales work
	- Cashflow 
		- No red flags
	- BS  
		- Net Debt / Property: ~40% 
		- Interest Coverage Ratio: 3x (low)
		- 75% debt fixed, but weighted debt maturity 2.4 years means they will be refinancing a lot of debt over next 1-2 years into much higher interest rates 
- The author's verdict 
	- Bearish on macro since Jan 2022
	- 'Real risk of sovereign debt crisis and AFC 2.0 in the months ahead; European recession a forgone conclusion'
	- Next 12-18 months, either 
		- Economy/markets break forcing Feds to turn dovish (base case): then want all the liquidity to go max long when it happens
			- *Once the Feds flip dovish, the next phase will be inflationary - debasement of fiat currency*. Then want to hold real assets, not cash 
		- Govts inject fiscal stimulus to counter tightening monetary policy: then skip market crash, go straight to inflation 
	- Biggest risk: rising interest rates 
	- If ok with cash locked up for 5 years, it's a decent buy
