- Best estimate for greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration in *watts per square metre (W/M^2)* at future points in time: a **crowdsourced GHG atmospheric concentration 'forward curve'**
	- You can then go long / short a GHG AC contract
- **Different entities** (companies, countries etc) will have **different exposures** to the **consequences** of GHG AC being different to the forward price. So they can **'hedge'** against movements in GHG AC that would be adverse to them 
## Examples 
- A low lying Pacific nation 
	- If things turn out worse than expected, more funds are needed to execute their preparation plans (physically preparing with seawalls, etc. or mass evacuation of citizens)
	- They can hedge the exposure by 'going long' a given GHG AC contract (e.g. 2070)
- A pension fund that owns a vast tracts of forest 
	- **Forestry is a growing asset class**. Forests' 'value' is directly linked to their ability to positive influence climate change. If somehow the climate change situation improves, the value of forests may decline
	- So the fund can hedge its exposure to this eventuality by 'going short' a given GHG AC contract (e.g. 2035)
