> [!tldr] Summary
> 
>  The 'Amazon for Southeast Asia' relies on Garena (gaming division) to fuel Shopee's expansion (which is still bleeding money); SeaMoney (fintech division) is still small but there is a huge opportunity with 70% of the SEA population unbanked/underbanked; it could become the region's version of Ant Financial 

- Sea started off with Garena and focusing on low-bandwidth consumers in Southeast Asia 
- Produced the hit game *Free Fire* that brought in billions in revenue 
- It has ventured into Brazil / Latin America, but has recently pulled back to focus on SEA again. But that market represents a huge opportunity 
- Improving unit economics 
- Culturally, Sea operates more like Chinese tech companies than Western ones: strong, top-down culture with leadership heavily involved in day-to-day decision-making. Work ethic and execution ability are touted as important strengths 
- Keyman risk with president Chris Feng (prone to overworking); power may need to be decentralised 
- SeaMoney: low penetration of traditional banking services is a huge opportunity to become the region's de-facto institution: *SEA's version of Ant Financial*
	- It's already considering buying an Indonesian insurance company 
- If it can 'find the next *Free Fire*' as its money mill, 'all bets are off' and it can invest more aggressively in Shopee and SeaMoney 

> Sea has one of the highest ceilings in the corporate world. It runs three growing business lines across regional markets with scaling spending power. Extraordinary events or extreme patience are required for Sea to join the trillionaireâ€™s club of Amazon and Apple. Still, it does not seem impossible to believe it could improve 10-20x from here, eclipsing its last high. Adherents may reasonably argue that Sea has venture capital upside, despite already doing $10 billion in revenue a year.
