## TLDR: Key takeaways (page 4)
- CEXes still dominate; DEX/CEX ratio is only ~13% (July 2022)
- Token emissions help grow DEXes (incentivising liquidity providers). But native tokens with minimal utility tend to see the value of their tokens erode 
- DEXes are not profitable yet (after token emissions / LP incentives)
- Looking ahead: inter-DEX competition and disruptive threat of aggregators likely will remain high. DEXes should focus on 
	- Winning LPs to deepen liquidity of their trading pools 
	- Increase user stickiness and platform loyalty 
- Amalgamation of previously disparate worlds of DeFi and NFTs
	- Cross-adoption of technologies 
	- Cross-vertical acquisitions 


## DEXes analytical framework
### TLDR 
- Today, **focus is on fundamentals** rather than vanity metrics (yields / TVL), and long-term sustainability of business models, which can be seen as increasing maturity of the market 
- **Two stakeholders**: token holders (interested in longevity of the DEX) and liquidity providers (just interested in yields). **Tokenomics** plays a part in ensuring their **interests are aligned** 
- DEXes nowadays are trying to find ways to increase **utility** of their tokens, or some form of locking mechanism. This can help reduce mercenary selling pressure 
### Yields → TVL → Fundamentals 
- Yields: DeFi summer (>1000% APYs). Not sustainable 
- TVL: easy metric to measure demand. But drawback: protocols can boost TVL artificially through inflationary token incentives
- Fundamentals: focusing on sustainability of business models; increased scrutiny on profitability and fee accrual mechanisms and how returns flow to token holders 
### Tokenomics
- Token emissions: contribute to operations and sustainability of DEXes by incentivising liquidity. But this erodes token value, especially those with minimal utility. LPs without sufficient reason to hold would simply sell the token when they receive it
- **Misalignment of interests** between **token holders** (who are interested in longevity of DEX) and **liquidity providers** (just interested in yields)
- **Utility of tokens**: DEXes nowadays are trying to find ways to increase utility of their tokens, or some form of locking mechanism. This can help reduce mercenary selling pressure

## Questions 
2022.09.11 
- If DEXes take up such a big proportion of the activity on blockchains, what is the real utility of blockchains? DEXes are meant to facilitate trading of tokens, that can't be the main use of a blockchain
	- PancakeSwap is the leading dApp on BNB chain (56% TVL) → what else is happening on BNB chain other than >50% of activity spent trading tokens?
