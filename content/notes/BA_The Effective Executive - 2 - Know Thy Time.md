## The Effective Executive - 2: 
[The Effective Executive](notes/B_The%20Effective%20Executive.md)
#### Paraphrased summary
*2021.08.12*
- **Characteristics of time**
	- It is the **scarcest resource**, with totally inelastic supply; there is no substitute for time
	- To be effective you need to control time management *perpetually*
- **Time diagnosis**
	- **First step** towards executive effectiveness: **recording actual time use**
	- How much **discretionary time can you realistically call your own**? 
	- With this log, **rethink and rework your schedule**. Ensure you have sufficient **continuous time** (time blocking) rather than pockets of time 
	- Time use does improve with practice, but only **constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting**
	- **Second step: systematic time management**: finding non-productive, time-wasting activities and get rid of them as soon as possible. 3 diagnostic questions
		- What would happen if this were not done at all? 
		- Which activities could be done by someone else just as well, if not better?
		- Don't waste the time of others 
- **Pruning time wasters**
	- The recurrent 'crisis' - can be mechanised/operationalised
	- Meetings: 'by definition a concession to deficient organisation for one either meets or one works'
- **Consolidating discretionary time**
	- [[Time block planning]]: **==To be effective, we need time in fairly large chunks==** (many small bits of time do not add up to one large chunk of time)
	- [[C_Deep Work]] in the morning rather than evening: 
		- Better than evening, when most people are too tired for a good job
		- And doing in the evening enables you to avoid tackling time and its management during the day

#### Copied passages
> All effective executives **control their time management *perpetually***. They not only keep a **continuing log** and **analyze it periodically**. They **set themselves deadlines** for the **important activities,** based on their judgment of their **discretionary time.**

> **Time is the scarcest resource**, and **unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed**. The **analysis of one’s time**, moreover, is the one easily accessible and yet systematic way to analyze one’s work and to think through what really matters in it. “Know Thyself,” the old prescription for wisdom, is almost impossibly difficult for mortal men. But everyone can follow the injunction **“Know Thy Time”** if he wants to, and be well on the road toward contribution and effectiveness.

> **The supply of time is totally inelastic**. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it and no marginal utility curve for it. Moreover, time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday’s time is gone forever and will never come back. Time is, therefore, always in exceedingly short supply. **There is no substitute for time.**

> Yet most of the tasks of the executive require, for minimum effectiveness, **a fairly large quantum of time**. To spend in one stretch less than this minimum is sheer waste. One accomplishes nothing and has to begin all over again.

 >To be effective, every knowledge worker, and especially every executive, therefore needs to be able to dispose of time in **fairly large chunks**. To have small dribs and drabs of time at his disposal will not be sufficient even if the total is an impressive number of hours.
##### Time diagnosis 
- The first step toward executive effectiveness is therefore to **record actual time-use**.
- A good many effective executives keep such a log continuously and look at it regularly every month. After each such sample, they **rethink and rework their schedule.** But six months later, they invariably find that they have **“drifted” into wasting their time on trivia.** ==Time-use does improve with practice. But only constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting==.
- **Systematic time management** is therefore the next step. One has to find the nonproductive, time-wasting activities and get rid of them if one possibly can. This requires asking oneself a number of **diagnostic questions.**
	1. First one tries to **identify and eliminate the things that need not be done at all**, the things that are purely waste of time without any results whatever. To find these time-wastes, one asks of all activities in the time records: **“What would happen if this were not done at all?”** And if the answer is, “Nothing would happen,” then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.
	2. The next question is: “Which of the activities on my time log could be done by somebody else just as well, if not better?”
	3. A common cause of time-waste is largely under the executive’s control and can be eliminated by him. That is the **time of others he himself wastes**.
##### Pruning time wasters
- identify the time-wasters which follow from lack of system or foresight. The symptom to look for is the ==recurrent “crisis,”== the crisis that comes back year after year. A crisis that recurs a second time is a crisis that must not occur again.
- **Meetings** are by definition a concession to deficient organization for one either meets or one works. One cannot do both at the same time.
	- Wherever a time log shows the fatty degeneration of meetings—whenever, for instance, people in an organization find themselves in meetings a quarter of their time or more—there is time-wasting malorganization.
- The last major time-waster is malfunction in information
##### Consolidating discretionary time
- The effective executive therefore knows that **he has to consolidate his discretionary time**. He knows that **he needs large chunks of time and that small driblets are no time at all**. Even one quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done. But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen minutes here or half an hour there
- **Deep work in the morning (rather than evening)**: One of the most effective executives in Professor Sune Carlson’s study, mentioned above, spent ninety minutes each morning **before** going to work in a study without a telephone at home. Even if this means working very early so as to get to the office on time, it is preferable to the most popular way of getting to the important work: **taking it home in the evening and spending three hours after dinner on it.** By that time, **most executives are too tired to do a good job**. Certainly those of middle age or older are better off going to bed earlier and getting up earlier. And **==the reason why working home nights is so popular is actually its worst feature: It enables an executive to avoid tackling his time and its management during the day.==**
- Effective executives start out by **estimating how much discretionary time they can realistically call their own.** Then they set aside **continuous time in the appropriate amount**. And if they find later that other matters encroach on this reserve, they scrutinize their record again and get rid of some more time demands from less than fully productive activities. They know that, as has been said before, one rarely overprunes.
