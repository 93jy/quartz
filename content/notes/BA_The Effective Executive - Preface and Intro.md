## Preface
To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be intelligent, to work hard, or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something separate, something different. But to be effective also does not require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” 
## Introduction: What makes an effective executive? 
- The 8 practices
	- They asked, “What needs to be done?”
	- They asked, “What is right for the enterprise?”
	- They developed action plans.
	- They took responsibility for decisions.
	- They took responsibility for communicating.
	- They were focused on opportunities rather than problems. 
	- They ran productive meetings.
	- They thought and said “we” rather than “I.”
- **Get the Knowledge you need**
	- I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time. Hence, after asking what needs to be done, the effective executive sets priorities and sticks to them
	- Other tasks, no matter how important or appealing, are postponed. However, after completing the original top- priority task, the executive **resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list**. He asks, “**What must be done now?**” This generally results in new and different priorities.
- **Write an action plan**
	- **Executives are doers; they execute**. Knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds. But before springing into action, the executive needs to **plan his course**. He needs to think about desired **results**, probable **restraints**, future **revisions**, **check-in points**, and **implications** for how he’ll spend his time.
	- “What contributions should the enterprise expect from me over the next 18 months to two years? What results will I commit to? With what deadlines?” 
	- Restraints on action
	- the action plan needs to create a **system for checking the results** against the expectations.
	- It should be **revised often**, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure
	- The action plan has to become the **basis for time management**. **==Time is the executive's scarcest and most precious resource==**
- **Act**
	- **Take responsibility for decisions**
		- A **systematic decision review** can be a powerful tool for self- development, too. Checking the results of a decision against its expectations shows executives what their strengths are, where they need to improve, and where they lack knowledge or information. It shows them their biases.
	- **Take responsibility for communicating**
	- **Focus on opportunities (rather than problems)**
		- Problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.
	- **Make meetings productive**
		- The key to running an effective meeting is to decide in advance what kind of meeting it will be. Different kinds of meetings require different forms of preparation and different results
		- **Good follow up** is just as important as the meeting itself
		- **Think and say "We"**
- **Listen first, speak last**
