## Summary + Notes
[[BA_Antifragile_B1 Antifragile - An Introduction]]

## Chapter 15 - History written by the losers 
(incomplete)
- Corporate Teleology, p234
	- [[Strategic]] planning: no evidence that it actually works, even evidence against it 
	- 'Almost everything theoretical in management has been exposed as pseudoscience - and like most economic theories, lives in a world parallel to evidence'
	- 'Business drift': Companies that [[C_Pivot]], such as Coca Cola, Tiffany and Co. Examples cited of businesses that drifted - but how many didn't? What's the proportion that do? 
- **Inverse turkey problem, p234**
	- **What you don't see can be both significant and hidden from the past**. Whether the significance is positive or negative depends on whether it's fragile or antifragile 
	- [[C_Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence]]: antifragile: good news tends to be absent from past data. 'Hiding qualities, not the defects'. Fragile: bad news doesn't show easily.
	- Fragile Turkey problem: exposed to large downside (e.g. blockfi) with limited outside; negative asymmetry
		- e.g. banking industry 
	- Antifragile Inverse turkey problem (positive asymmetry): the 'unseen' is positive, so we tend to underestimate the total benefits by missing the positive events 
		- E.g. biotech industry / anything R&D
	- The consequence is *anything in economic life that has antifragile properties is inhibited* as people don't recognise the hidden upside, instead favouring the fragile 'sure bet'
	- **[[2_Reinsurance]] companies**: catastrophic events hit RI only negatively, and *tend to be absent from past data*. So it's not that RI premiums are too high for cat events; how do you even price the risk if such events are absent from past data? 
	- **Payoffs bounded left or right** (most payoffs in life fall in either)
		- Left: limited losses with huge upside (Thales' bet)
		- Right: limited gains with huge downside (banking, insurance)
##  Chapter 16 - A lesson in disorder
- p241: There is no evidence that abilities in chess lead to better reasoning off the chessboard. While we accept the domain-specificity of games, we find it hard to apply this lesson to technical skills applied in schools: *what is picked up in the classroom stays largely in the classroom*
- **An Antifragile (Barbell) Education**: very relatable, as it talks about good grades isn't so useful outside school
	- Be an 'autodidact', a person of knowledge compared to students who swallow school material, and knowledge only derived from the curriculum. The edge isn't in the package of the official program of school, which *everyone knew with small variations multiplying into large discrepancies in grades*, but *what exactly lay outside it*
	- Analogy of gym rats vs street gangsters: you can lift heavy weights but fail to lift a stone, and get hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. The gym rat's strength is extremely *domain-specific and their domain doesn't exist outside of ludic - extremely organised - constructs*. In fact, their strength, as with overspecialised athletes, is the result of a *deformity*.
	- This is a lesson also in being [[Farnam Street|positioned for success]], **don't need to be so focused on a certain goal, a certain exam to pass**... Not like the actuarial lecturer (or maybe he's just learning more widely but in a more structured way). 
	- The author reads voraciously outside a curriculum, away from the gym machine. He keeps a log of his reading hours since age 13 (30-60 / week!) #actionable and that's what I do already 
	- So why is this better than being a very good student? Perhaps because of the domain specificity of doing well on exams. 
	- A personal story of the author on how he started to specialise deeply in risk (small probability events, black swans...) and made a career out of it after just going down the rabbit hole and reading very voraciously, not in the structured way of schooling. Maybe the lesson here is that **don't read or try to learn stuff with the explicit intention of getting something out of it**... 
	- *What one needs to know for a profession is necessarily what lies outside the corpus, as far away from the centre as possible.* How to apply this to actuarial, when in the early years exams plays a central role to your career? At least I'm done with exams for now! Maybe to convince me for now **not to study for more exams...** 

## Chapter 17 - Fat Tony Debates Socrates
2022.07.11
- **Overall thoughts:** a bit hard to follow everything, but it seems like he is trying to explain that you *don't need to be able to explain everything for it to make sense*. And some other seemingly important points like payoff being the most important thing. And that we decide based on fragility, not probability 
- The difference between *narrated, intelligible knowledge* vs the more *opaque kind entirely probed by tinkering.* It is incorrect to think that things always have a reason that we can understand easily
	- The 'most severe mistake in life': mistaking the unintelligible for the unintelligent. i.e. **What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent** ([[2_Nietzsche]]). **Mistaking what you don't see as non-existent**, a sibling of [[C_Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence]]. [[C_Turkey problem]]
		- The fragilista mistakes what he does not understand for nonsense
- [[2_Socrates]] and his questions...  [[C_Socratic Method]]. What Socrates was seeking are the definitions of the essential nature of the thing concerned rather than descriptions of the properties by means of which we can recognise them. 
- [[2_Nietzsche]]'s *The Birth of Tragedy*: the 2 forces, Apollonian (rational) and Dionysian (untamed, hard to understand). Yin and yang. ...
- 'Structured learning likes the impoverishment and simplification of naive rationalism, easy to teach, not the rich texture of empiricism'. 
	- Ernest Renan: logic, by definition, excludes nuances, and since *truth resides exclusively in the nuances*, logic is a 'useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences'
- 'Things are too complicated to be expressed in words'. Another thing I heard before: you need the vocabulary of something to be useful to converse about it, or something like that. How to marry these 2 ideas together? 
- How the ancients saw *naive rationalism*: by impoverishing, rather than enhancing, thought, it introduces fragility. Incompleteness, *half knowledge*, is always dangerous 
- **Traditions** provide an *aggregation of filtered collective knowledge* - also an idea from [[B_The Secret of Our Success]]
- *Nonliterate people* also have their own 'science of the concrete', a holistic way of thinking about their environment in terms of objects and their 'secondary', sensuous qualities which are *not necessarily less coherent than many of our scientific approaches* and in many respects can be as rich or richer than ours 
- The sucker-nonsucker distinction 
	- Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. People talk about payoff, exposure and consequences (risks and rewards). The **payoff is the most important thing, not the event itself**
	- Exposure is more important than knowledge; decision effects supersede logic 
- **We decide principally based on fragility, not probability**
	- To rephrase: we *decide principally based on fragility, not so much on True/False*
	- Almost all decisions have an asymmetric payoff, one side carrying a larger consequence than the other


# Book V: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear
## Chapter 18 - On the difference between a large stone and a thousand pebbles 
- A simple rule to detect the fragile p268
	- Central argument: why fragility is generally in the nonlinear and not in the linear 
	- For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock
		- we are immune to the cumulative effect of small deviations / shocks of very small magnitude (if not we will break apart from walking)
	- For the antifragile, it too is grounded in nonlinearities: shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point)
		- Example: weightlifting, strength training: 100kg once more benefit than 1kg 100 times (to build muscle)
- When to smile and when to frown p271 (convex and concave graphs)
	- Asymmetries: Gaining more than you lose (convex) vs losing more than you gain (concave)
- Traffic in New York p274: examples of convexity effects - traffic jams
	- Basically, the marginal cost concept: 10% increase in cars leads to 50% increase in travel time 
	- Another example: central banks printing money with no issue until a [[C~_Tipping point#]], jump in inflation 
	- Injection of [[C_Redundancy]]
- A 'balanced meal' p277: denial of *hormesis* (probably from earlier chapters). Consuming no protein on one day, catching up another day causes a different (better) physiological response, possibly because the deprivation, as a *stressor*, activates some pathways to facilitate subsequent absorption (or similar)
	- Health benefits are convex to speed (up to a point) - similar to the weightlifting point above 
- Small may be ugly, it is certainly less fragile p278
	- A *squeeze*: when people have no choice but to do something and right away, regardless of the costs ([[Farnam Street#FS forum highlights]] positioning for success: having buffers)
	- *Squeezes are exacerbated by size*. Despite [[C_Economies of scale]], size hurts you in times of stress - not a good idea to be large during difficult times 
		- *Squeezes* are much more expensive (relative to size) for large corporations
		- *The gains from size are visible but the risks are hidden*, and some concealed risks bring frailties into the companies 
	- Another example: market-moving trades from big companies ('slippage' in crypto DEX terms)
	- A nuance: it is the *size per segment* of a project that matters, not the entire project. If the project can be broken down (e.g. road building), less role for squeezes (small errors) vs monolithic projects that cannot be broken down (e.g. tunnel and bridge projects)
	- *It is completely wrong to use the calculus of benefits without including the probability of failure*. This seems commonsensical especially for an actuary, but still sounds so right 
	- *Smooth functioning at regular times is different from the rough functioning at times of stress*
	- *Bottlenecks are the mothers of all squeezes*
- Projects and prediction: why planes don't arrive early p283
	- [[C_Planning fallacy]] is the typical reason given for cost overruns in projects (overconfidence, etc.). But the counterpoint is that large-scale projects 150 years ago were completed on time, many even early (Empire State Building, Crystal Palace, etc.)
	- It was much a much more *linear* economy back then, less complex. Now we have more *nonlinearities*: asymmetries and convexities 
	- 'Efficiency' and thee removal of buffers - people now sail too close to the wind. There are now many *bottlenecks* and thee project get as weak as the weakest link (negative convexity effect)
	- Therefore, it's not just a psychological problem of 'planning fallacy'. It is just the nonlinear structure of projects; errors add to the right end. If uncertainty were linear, we would see some projects completed extremely early, but we only see projects completed extremely late.
