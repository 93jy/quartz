## The book in 3 sentences
## Impressions
- Was skeptical at first that this would be another productivity book but the book does have some actionable insights on how to better manage the information firehose, whether for work or personal projects 2022.09.18 
- Is this personal website the public facing portion of my second brain then? 
## How the book changed me
- Some similar ideas packaged in different ways
	- PARA: grouping by ideas/projects instead of type of note: something already kind of implemented in Obsidian and elsewhere. Not too new. But a good and deceptively simple framework? 
	- Organising for actionability rather than to have a perfect archive, location, tag for each note. Related: [[C_Perfect is the enemy of good|perfectionism]], [80-20 rule](notes/C_80-20%20rule.md)

## Chapter 2: What is a Second Brain?
> [!tldr] Summary
> To properly take advantage of the power of a Second Brain, we need a new relationship to information, to technology, and even to ourselves. The Second Brain acts as a **digital commonplace book**. It is a method to remove the brain as the bottleneck of your potential. 

> *(Loc 311)* In the professional world: It’s not at all clear what you should be taking notes on. No one tells you when or how your notes will be used. The “test” can come at any time and in any form. You’re allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them in the first place. You are expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them. This isn’t the same notetaking you learned in school. It’s time to elevate the status of notes from test prep and humble scribblings into something far more interesting and dynamic. For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “**knowledge building block**”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

> *(Loc 399)* Your brain is **no longer the bottleneck on your potential**, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful. This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail, because **[failure](notes/C_Failure.md) is just more information**, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey. This is what it’s like to build and harness the power of a Second Brain.

## Chapter 3: How a Second Brain Works
> [!tldr] Summary
> The SB has 4 essential capabilities: Making our ideas concrete, revealing new associations between ideas, incubating ideas over time, and sharpening our unique perspectives
> 
> The CODE Method 




### The 4 essential capabilities of a Second Brain
 *(Loc 448)* 
 - Making our ideas concrete 
 - Revealing new associations between ideas: *by keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we increase the likelihood we will notice unusual associations*
 - Incubating our ideas over time: *where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term: a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas*
 - Sharpening our unique perspectives: *jobs depend on our ability to advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it too*
- *(Loc 528)* **Informal**: Notes are inherently messy, so there's no need for perfect spelling or polished presentation. This makes it as easy and frictionless as possible to jot things down as soon as they occur to you, which is essential to allow nascent ideas to grow

A progression in the Second Brain journey

### The CODE Method: The 4 Steps to Remembering What Matters
- **Capture**: Keep what resonates
> *(Loc 612)* Adopting the habit of knowledge capture has immediate benefits for our mental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will fail us at a crucial moment. Instead of jumping at every new headline and notification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives and consciously let go of the rest.
- **Organise**: Save for actionability
> *(Loc 617)* Because our priorities and goals can change at a moment’s notice, and probably will, we want to avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive. The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”
- **Distill**: Find the essence. Finding the main point of a note (you would not have time to review 10 pages of notes on a book you read last year)
> *(Loc 632)* There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence. Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate. It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.

>*(Loc 640)* Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “**How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?**” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.

> *(Loc 640)* Think of yourself **not just as a taker of notes, but as a giver of notes**—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.
- **Express**: Show your work
> [!quote] *(Loc 655)* Information becomes knowledge —personal, embodied, verified—*only when we put it to use*. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.

> *(Loc 672)* Information is always in flux, and it is always a work in progress. Since nothing is ever truly final, there is no need to wait to get started. You can publish a simple website now, and slowly add additional pages over time... The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement.

- PARA: projects, areas, resources, archive
	- **Just 3 levels of hierarchy** for all the notes: top-level PARA, the individual project folders, and the notes themselves. Seems too simple?
	- The idea is to use this for every software you use 
	- Classifying the notes: going down the PARA list and seeing where it fits
	- *Organising by actionability*: counteracting our tendency to constantly procrastinate and postpone our actions into the far future
	- **Organising ideas based on where *they are going*, rather than where *they came from***: not based on books, but based on category. Seems like something that is compatible for Obsidian; I guess the book page is the starting point, then the key ideas go into the mental models pages. 2022.08.09 
		- PARA isn't a filing system but a *production* system. Not about finding the perfect place where a note belongs (there isn't one); the whole system is *constantly shifting and changing in sync with a constantly changing life*
- 2022.08.21 ==**Key idea of BASB: don't be too rigid and perfectionist**== ([[C_Perfect is the enemy of good]]) about your folders, notes etc... that's not the point. The key point is probably **being able to find them when you need to**. Not the perfect formatting and archiving. 
	- **Don't need to refine and make perfect notes all the time**; it's about keeping them **searchable**, when the time comes we have all the information easily within reach that can be found. 
	- This is very liberating, don't need to perfect all the notes in an onerous manner each time into obsidian; the **purpose of the notetaking is not to have neatly curated notes.**
- 2022.08.21 **Organise for actionability rather than neatness (the correct priority)**
- 2022.08.21 **Eventually, the useful notes will come to the surface (repetition) and they will get refined naturally into neat notes.** So don't need neat notes for every time I add something to the knowledge garden. 
- 2022.08.21 **Moving notes around: notes are not rigid or cast in stone**. Similar to above message, everything is fluid, not like a hardcopy notebook. Take advantage of that. 
- 2022.08.21 **Use the search function more**. Obsidian actually has a very powerful search function that I have neglected. And tags.
