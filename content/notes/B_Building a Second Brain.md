## The book in 3 sentences
## Impressions
- Was skeptical at first that this would be another productivity book but the book does have some actionable insights on how to better manage the information firehose, whether for work or personal projects 2022.09.18 
## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*
- Some similar ideas packaged in different ways
	- PARA: grouping by ideas/projects instead of type of note: something already kind of implemented in Obsidian and elsewhere. Not too new. But a good and deceptively simple framework? 
	- Organising for actionability rather than to have a perfect archive, location, tag for each note. Related: [[C_Perfect is the enemy of good|perfectionism]], [80-20 rule](notes/C_80-20%20rule.md)

## Summary + Notes
Ali abdaal video on this? What is the key message? 

> *(Loc 311)* In the professional world: It’s not at all clear what you should be taking notes on. No one tells you when or how your notes will be used. The “test” can come at any time and in any form. You’re allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them in the first place. You are expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them. This isn’t the same notetaking you learned in school. It’s time to elevate the status of notes from test prep and humble scribblings into something far more interesting and dynamic. For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “**knowledge building block**”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

> *(Loc 399)* Your brain is **no longer the bottleneck on your potential**, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful. This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail, because **[failure](notes/C_Failure.md) is just more information**, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey. This is what it’s like to build and harness the power of a Second Brain.

- PARA: projects, areas, resources, archive
	- **Just 3 levels of hierarchy** for all the notes: top-level PARA, the individual project folders, and the notes themselves. Seems too simple?
	- The idea is to use this for every software you use 
	- Classifying the notes: going down the PARA list and seeing where it fits
	- *Organising by actionability*: counteracting our tendency to constantly procrastinate and postpone our actions into the far future
	- **Organising ideas based on where *they are going*, rather than where *they came from***: not based on books, but based on category. Seems like something that is compatible for Obsidian; I guess the book page is the starting point, then the key ideas go into the mental models pages. 2022.08.09 
		- PARA isn't a filing system but a *production* system. Not about finding the perfect place where a note belongs (there isn't one); the whole system is *constantly shifting and changing in sync with a constantly changing life*
- 2022.08.21 ==**Key idea of BASB: don't be too rigid and perfectionist**== ([[C_Perfect is the enemy of good]]) about your folders, notes etc... that's not the point. The key point is probably **being able to find them when you need to**. Not the perfect formatting and archiving. 
	- **Don't need to refine and make perfect notes all the time**; it's about keeping them **searchable**, when the time comes we have all the information easily within reach that can be found. 
	- This is very liberating, don't need to perfect all the notes in an onerous manner each time into obsidian; the **purpose of the notetaking is not to have neatly curated notes.**
- 2022.08.21 **Organise for actionability rather than neatness (the correct priority)**
- 2022.08.21 **Eventually, the useful notes will come to the surface (repetition) and they will get refined naturally into neat notes.** So don't need neat notes for every time I add something to the knowledge garden. 
- 2022.08.21 **Moving notes around: notes are not rigid or cast in stone**. Similar to above message, everything is fluid, not like a hardcopy notebook. Take advantage of that. 
- 2022.08.21 **Use the search function more**. Obsidian actually has a very powerful search function that I have neglected. And tags.
