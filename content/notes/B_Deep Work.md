## The book in 3 sentences
- Deep work is more powerful than most people realise
- To succeed in this increasingly competitive knowledge economy, you need to prioritise deep work over shallow work (which is easily replicable by others)
- A bunch of actionable steps in Part 2 that show how to make Deep Work a part of your professional life 
	- Work deeply 
	- Embrace boredom in this distracted world
	- Quit social media, plan every minute of your time 
	- Drain the shallows
## Impressions
One of the first few self help books of this nature, one of the classics that I have been going to on and off. The commitment to deep work more solidified in 2021H2
## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.*
- Quit distracting sites, mindless surfing
- [[2_Time management]]
	- Be **intentional about time usage** - it is ok to have relaxation, but be intentional about it. Don't just do it mindlessly which will make you feel like a wasteman
	- [[Time block planning]] for weekdays. Giving each minute of your time a task. But the goal is again to be **intentional, rather than to completely follow strictly the plan**. That's why revisions are allowed.
- Doing difficult tasks to train concentration - e.g. [[1_Chess]]. And quit consuming clickbait, etc. Instead turn to Kindle in downtime, or **just be bored**. That will also help with concentration. 
- [[Evening ritual]] Shutdown ritual: knowing when to stop, not letting these open loops eat into your personal time


## Top quotes
On Time Block Planning: 
> - This type of scheduling **is not about constraint, but about thoughtfulness**. It is a **simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask, ==what makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?==**. In fact **==it is the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer==**
> - ... the recognition that **a deep work habit requires you to ==treat your time with respect==**. A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: ***Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday***. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.

On intentionality of how you spend your time (even **leisure** time): 
 >- **Figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin**. **Structured hobbies** provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate **specific actions with specific goals** to fill your time. A set program of reading, à la Bennett, where you spend regular time each night making progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is, of course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.
>- If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, **you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed**, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in **semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing**.

## Actionable steps (from Part 2)
### [[B_Deep Work Rule 1 - Work deeply|Rule #1: Work deeply]]
- **Decide on your depth philosophy**
- **Ritualise**: general questions for any effective ritual
	- **Where you will work and for how long**
	- **How you will work once you start to work:** rules and processes to keep efforts structured, e.g. ban on internet use, or **metric** like words produced
	- **How you will support your work:** e.g. cup of good coffee, food, environmental factors
- **Make grand gestures**
- **Don't work alone**
- **Execute like a business** (tough part: executing the strategy) - 4DX framework from Christensen 
	- **Discipline #1: Focus on the wildly important**
		- Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours
		- Have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits 
	- **Discipline #2: Act on the lead measures**
		- Fundamental premise of 4DX: [[C_execution is more difficult than strategising]]
		- Lag measures too late; lead measures measure new behaviours that will drive success on lag measures 
		- ==Time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to your wildly important goal==
	- **Discipline #3: Keep a compelling scoreboard**
		- Also to calibrate expectations for number of hours of deep work needed per result
	- **Discipline #4: Create a cadence of accountability**
		- [[C_Weekly, quarterly review and plan]]: making a plan for the workweek ahead (see rule #4)
		- Celebrate good weeks, understand what led to bad weeks, how to ensure good score for days ahead
- **Shutdown ritual**
	- [[B_Deep Work Rule 1 - Work deeply#3 possible reasons why downtime is so important|3 reasons why downtime is so important]]
		- Downtime aids insights 
		- Downtime helps recharge energy needed to work deeply 
		- The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important (debatable... You still need to do your admin tasks)
	- Accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention 
	- Every incomplete task, goal, project has been reviewed and for each, confirmed that either (1) there is a plan you trust for its completion, (2) it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right
	- Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done. 
### [[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom|Rule #2: Embrace boredom]]
- Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction 
- **[[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom#Internet blocks Don't take breaks from distraction Instead take breaks from focus|Internet blocks]]**: don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus 
	- This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use and/or prompt email replies: just schedule more internet blocks
	- Regardless of how blocks are scheduled, must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from internet use 
	- 5-min gap between current moment and the next time you can go online: separating the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so 
- **[[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom#Internet blocks Don't take breaks from distraction Instead take breaks from focus|Scheduling internet use at home as well as work]]** can further improve concentration training
	- Scheduling internet use **at home** as well as at work can further improve concentration training: maintain the strategy even after the workday is over 
	- Can schedule lots of long internet blocks. The key here isn't to avoid or even reduce the total amount of time engaged in distracting behaviour, but to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout the evening to switching to distractions *at the slightest hint of boredom*
	- Waiting in line: simply wait and be bored, very valuable as a form of concentration training 
- **[[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom#Work like Teddy Roosevelt|Work like Teddy Roosevelt]]**: artificial deadlines 
	- Interval training for attention centres of your brain 
	- These dashes are incompatible with distraction (cannot give in to distraction and still make the deadlines)
- **[[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom#Meditate productively Mindfulness prac|Meditate productively]]**
	- A period where you are **occupied physically but not mentally: walking, jogging, driving, showering** - and focus your attention on a **single well-defined professional problem**
	- Always bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls
	- This strengthens the distraction-resisting muscles, sharpening concentration
	- 2 suggestions
		- Be wary of distractions and looping 
		- Structure your deep thinking 
	- **[[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom#Memorise a deck of cards|Memorise a deck of cards]]** - or chess? 
		- Memory training: improving your ability to concentrate 
		- Nothing special about card memorisation. Any structured though process that require unwavering attention can have a similar effect 
		- Motivating idea: **the ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it**
### [[B_Deep Work Rule 3 - Quit social media|Rule #3: Quit social media]]: Don't use the internet to entertain yourself #important 
- You both **should and can make deliberate use of your time outside work**
- Using the internet for entertainment can **weaken your general ability to resist distraction**, making deep work more difficult later when really concentrating
- Hence, ==put more thought into your leisure time: don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but dedicate some advance thinking to how you want to spend your 'day within a day'==
- Sites like reddit **thrive in a vacuum: if you haven't given yourself something to do in a given moment, they always beckon as an appealing option**
	- If you instead fill this free time with something of more quality, their grip on your attention will loosen 
- So ==figure out in advance what you're going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin==  
	- ==Structured hobbies==: specific actions and specific goals to fill your time
	- e.g. a **set program of reading, spending regular time each night making progress on a series of deliberately chosen books**
	- e.g. exercise
- ==**If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.**==

### [[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows|Rule #4: Drain the shallows]]
- **Time is like a sponge**: There is a lot of room to trim the fat out of a typical workday/week
- **The issue of cognitive capacity**: deep work is exhausting, usually not more than 4 hours a day limit 
	- Beyond that, it's **diminishing returns**. So, shallow work does not become dangerous until you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day
##### ==[[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows#Schedule every minute of your day Time block planning|Schedule every minute of your day (TBP)]]==
- **We spend much of our day on autopilot**. We need the habit of pausing before action and asking, **what makes the most sense right now?**
- Every minute of the day should be part of a block, giving every minute of your workday a job
- If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day 
	- On some days, you might rewrite your schedule 6 times. **Don't despair** if that happens. The goal is **not to stick to a given schedule at all costs**. It is instead to **maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward, even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds**
- 2 ways of coping with **schedule revisions**
	- You are **almost definitely going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things**. Should make an effort to **accurately (conservatively) predict the time tasks will require**
	- **Overflow conditional tasks**: an additional block with a split purpose. If need more time for current task, keep working at it, else, move on to this conditional task
- This type of scheduling **is not about constraint, but about thoughtfulness**. It is a **simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask, ==what makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?==**. In fact **==it is the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer==**
- **Treat your time with respect**: decide in advance what you're going to do with every minute of your workday. 
##### [[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows#Quantify the depth of every activity|Quantify the depth of every activity]]
- Evaluate activities by asking a simple question: ==how long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialised training in my field to complete this task?==
	- If requires many months, indicates the task **leverages hard-won expertise**. These tend to be deep tasks
	- Bias your time towards such tasks
##### [[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows#Finish your work by 5 30|Finish your work by 5:30]]: Fixed schedule productivity 
- Fixed schedule productivity: fixing the firm goal of not working beyond a certain time, then working backward to find productivity strategies allowing me to satisfy this declaration
- [[Saying No]]: be very cautious about saying "yes" (most dangerous word in productivity vocabulary)
- Be *ambiguous* in the explanation for refusal - don't enough specificity in the excuse for the requester the opportunity to defuse it 
- Fixed-schedule productivity shifts you to a ==scarcity mindset==. Default answer is no...
- This is a ==meta-habit== that is simple to adopt but broad in impact 

##### [[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows#Become hard to reach|Become hard to reach]]
- Do more work when replying or sending emails: good process-centric message can 'close the loop'

## Introduction
- Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, **logistical-style tasks**, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
- Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad) is **exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity** for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing **depth**
- Deep work is a skill that has great value today
	- Learning: We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.
	- The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, **its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless**—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is **mediocre**, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to **find a better alternative online.** 
		- Whether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.
- **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly **rare** at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly **valuable** in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
- Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

## Conclusion
Deep work is way more powerful than most people understand.

The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully now that you’ve finished this book, you agree too.
