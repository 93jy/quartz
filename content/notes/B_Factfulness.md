[Books](notes/Books.md) #book | [Factfulness: Kindle highlights](notes/BK_Factfulness.md)
Date summarised (quickly): 2021.07.25
## The book in 3 sentences
- Ten instincts / **biases** that distort the way we view the world. We should be aware of these biases when looking at the world. Instead we should develop a **fact-based worldview** instead of the default *overdramatic worldview*
- The book provides 10 [mental models](notes/Mental%20model%20collection.md) for viewing the world as a whole - how to counter these 'instincts' to achieve a fact-based worldview 
## Impressions
At first the condescending tone of people always getting the answers wrong was quite harsh but some important points were made. Just shows how easy it is, with the media and the various content we consume, to get a completely wrong picture of how the world looks. 

The world is improving even if the media and what you read tells you that it is getting worse (mainly because they need to sensationalise to get clicks/views).

This book has some useful tidbits on the world at the big picture, can read the [Factfulness: Kindle highlights](notes/BK_Factfulness.md), some good ones in there. 

## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.*
- 4 levels. Definitely we are living on level 4, and levels 1-3 all look equally poor (when they are not)
- Some mental models to keep in mind when reading news or current affairs. And in general towards life; some are quite universally applicable, e.g.
	- Realising the 'us vs them' mentality and tendency to dichotomise 
	- Generalising: thinking that what you don't know is a monolith and everything 'them' is the same (Level 1-3, other religions, cultures, etc.)
	- Realising that the human mind likes simple ideas that generalise and explain everything, but the world is much more complex than that 
	- Data, statistics, media are all very misleading since there are conflicting motives (e.g. to get our attention) - so we must be very mindful of how we process such information (e.g. comparing, dividing to get per capita)
## Top quotes
> **Why is the misconception of a gap between the rich and the poor so hard to change?** I think this is because human beings have a **strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking**, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize. Good versus bad. Heroes versus villains. My country versus the rest. Dividing the world into two distinct sides is simple and intuitive, and also dramatic because it implies conflict, and we do it without thinking, all the time.

> It is easy to be aware of all the bad things happening in the world. It’s harder to know about the good things: billions of improvements that are never reported

> Practice distinguishing between a **level** (e.g., bad) and a **direction** of change (e.g., better). Convince yourself that **things can be both better and bad.**

> The kind of information we seem most likely to process is stories: information that sounds dramatic.

> The gap instinct divides the world into “us” and “them,” and **the generalization instinct makes “us” think of “them” as all the same.**

> **The PIN code of the world is 1-1-1-4. That’s how to remember the map. From left to right, the number of billions, as a PIN code. Americas: 1, Europe: 1, Africa: 1, Asia: 4.** (I have rounded the numbers.) **Like all PIN codes, this one will change.** By 2100 the new PIN code of the world will be **1-1-4-5**. More than 80 percent of the world’s population will live in Africa and Asia.

> **We find simple ideas very attractive** ([[B_Superforecasting]] / [Foxes v hedgehogs](notes/C_Foxes%20v%20hedgehogs.md)). We enjoy that moment of insight, we enjoy feeling we really understand or know something. And it is easy to take off down a slippery slope, from one attention-grabbing simple idea to a feeling that this idea beautifully explains, or is the beautiful solution for, lots of other things. The world becomes simple. All problems have a single cause—something we must always be completely against. Or all problems have a single solution—something we must always be for. Everything is simple. There’s just one small issue. **We completely misunderstand the world**. I call this preference for single causes and single solutions the single perspective instinct.


## Summary + Notes
### The instincts
- **Chapter One: The Gap Instinct**
- **Chapter Two: The Negativity Instinct**
	- Factfulness is … recognizing when we get negative news, and remembering that information about bad events is much more likely to reach us. When things are getting better we often don’t hear about them. This gives us a systematically too-negative impression of the world around us, which is very stressful. To control the negativity instinct, expect bad news.
- **Chapter Three: The Straight Line Instinct**
	- Factfulness is … recognizing the assumption that a line will just continue straight, and remembering that such lines are rare in reality.
- **Chapter Four: The Fear Instinct**
- **Chapter Five: The Size Instinct**
	- Comparing: Avoid lonely numbers. They should always compared against something
		- [80-20 rule](notes/C_80-20%20rule.md)
	- Dividing: look at rates, per head, etc. 
- **Chapter Six: The Generalization Instinct**
	- The gap instinct divides the world into “us” and “them,” and **the generalization instinct makes “us” think of “them” as all the same.**
- **Chapter Seven: The Destiny Instinct**
	- The destiny instinct is the idea that innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries, religions, or cultures
- **Chapter Eight: The Single Perspective Instinct**
	- We find simple ideas very attractive. We enjoy that moment of insight, we enjoy feeling we really understand or know something. And it is easy to take off down a slippery slope, from one attention-grabbing simple idea to a feeling that this idea beautifully explains, or is the beautiful solution for, lots of other things. The world becomes simple. All problems have a single cause—something we must always be completely against. Or all problems have a single solution—something we must always be for. Everything is simple. There’s just one small issue. We completely misunderstand the world. I call this preference for single causes and single solutions the single perspective instinct.
- **Chapter Nine: The Blame Instinct**
	- The blame instinct is the instinct to find a clear, simple reason for why something bad has happened.
- **Chapter Ten: The Urgency Instinct**
	- Factfulness is … recognizing when a decision feels urgent and remembering that it rarely is. To control the urgency instinct, take small steps.
- **Chapter Eleven: Factfulness in Practice**
- **Factfulness Rules of Thumb**
