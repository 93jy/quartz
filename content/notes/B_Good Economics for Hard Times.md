## The End of Growth? 
- The big question: what does growth happen? Why does it seem like growth has slowed down / stopped in developed nations? What accounts for growth differences in different countries?
- The Glorious Thirty 
	- Concept of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), to explain differences in productivity that cannot be measured 
	- Workers may be able to produce more output today compared to previously given the same machines and hours. Why? They become more efficient... Maybe better processes? 'TFP' increasing when we discover new ways to reduce waste / time in producing things 
- The Less Glorious Forty 
	- After 1973 (oil crisis era), growth seemed to have stopped. There seems to have been a lot of innovation (technological age) without corresponding economic growth - why? And will it return? 
	- Perhaps GDP is not the right thing to measure in the first place. It doesn't capture things like 'joy'
- Is Growth Over?
	- Gordon vs Mokyr
	- Gordon believes growth is over, and all the new tech (machine learning, AI, etc) have done nothing for growth 
	- Mokyr is more optimistic
	- [[2_Fourth industrial revolution]]
	- Conclusion: there could be no way of finding out other than waiting. 
- The war of the flowers 
	- GDP values only things that can be priced and marketed.
	- The recent slowdown in measured productivity growth coincides with the explosion of social media. How to measure the impact on wellbeing? 
- Growth happens
	- p160 The most showy breakthroughs will always be in the more advanced countries, but most technology upgrading is just moving from day-before-yesterday's tech to yesterday's. This is typically easier than pushing the frontier, precisely because it has already been done and we know exactly how to do it; just pulling things off the shelf rather than coming up with something new. Related: [[C_Invest in things that take you from 0 to 1]] 
	- Exogenous growth model: driven by outside forces or effects; acknowledging our inability to do anything about the long-run growth rate. Solow thinks growth is beyond our control 
- Give me a lever
	- p161 The reason why India was poor could not be all because of a shortage of skills and capital. 'Intrinsic productivity' of capital could be lower in India? 
	- Countries are poor in substantial part because they *make less good of the resources they have*. The question is *why?*
	- [[Communism]]: Marx viewed that capitalism was doomed because the insatiable greed of the capitalist class in the pursuit of more and more capital would drive the return on capital ([[C_Diminishing returns]]) into the ground ('falling rate of profit') and precipitate the crises that eventually end capitalism 
		- Counterexamples: economies of scale (like Amazon)
	- p164: Silicon Valley environment - cross pollination of ideas in the grouping of high-skilled people in the same industry 
- Growth stories p165
	- Talking about growth: very high level - 'telescoping an incredible amount of real-world complexity into as few building blocks as possible'
		- Difficult to map abstractions onto the real world [[C_Level of abstraction]]? From individuals to whole economy (which the theories are based on)
		- It is also hard to compare economy to economy as they are not very comparable, many differences 
		- Basically, what we observe can have many reasons (correlation and causation), so it's hard to draw conclusions 
	- Basically, the obsession with growth may be barking up the wrong tree
		- It is very difficult to *measure* growth in the first place. It is even harder to know *what drives it*, and therefore to make *policy* to make growth happen
		- So maybe economists should stop focusing on growth, instead the most important question (in rich countries) is how to improve the *quality of life* of the average citizen 
- The million dollar plant p167
	- How to attract growth in a city? Offer more incentives? Build infrastructure?
	- Growth in a region is different from national growth because it can cannibalise growth in the rest of the economy 
- Charter cities p170
	- Urbanisation in India: cities grow horizontally, by outgrowing former boundaries, rather than vertically through taller and better-quality buildings 
	- This form of urbanisation just increases pollution travel times - not business friendly or liveable, so it's actually more difficult to attract talent, and limits the 'concentration' effect and cross pollination of ideas 
- Creative destruction p172
	- In the real world, production of new ideas is a much more fraught affair. Many marketable ideas are produced by *firms*, and firms tend to be possessive about their discoveries. *Industrial espionage* is a major industry today, and so is its foil, *patent law*
