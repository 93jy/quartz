## The book in 3 sentences
## Impressions
The book has a lot of advice for the creative types, and many biographies and descriptions of how they achieved mastery through the various means. I always try to think whether these examples are relatable to my life and my personality, but maybe that is not the way to treat the examples. 

## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*

## Summary + Notes
- p209. The greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the desire to hurry up the process. Master the basics first. *Love learning for its own sake. Anyone who would spend 10 years absorbing the techniques and conventions of their field, trying them out, mastering them, exploring and personalising them, would inevitably find their authentic voice and give birth to something unique and expressive.* Similar to [[~B_Antifragile#Chapter 16 A lesson in disorder]]
- The Fact of Great Yield
	- You must read journals and books from all different fields. Sometimes you will find an interesting anomaly in an unrelated discipline that would have implications for your own. Keep your mind completely open
	- Another similar reminder to [[~B_Antifragile#Chapter 16 A lesson in disorder]], going farther and wider in the research and not being too *directed / task oriented* in finding answers. Curiosity may be the key 
- The high end p230
	- We often get into *technical lock*, i.e. locked into seeing every problem in the same way especially after trying to master a complex skill. We lose sight of the bigger picture, the purpose of what we are doing, and sink into *tunnel vision*
	- We must always connect the problem/project to *something larger* - a bigger question, an overarching idea, an inspiring goal. Always return to the larger purpose and goal whenever the project becomes stale. This bigger idea governs the smaller paths of investigation 
- **[[C_Evolutionary hijacking]]** p235
	- Creativity resembles a process known in nature as *evolutionary hijacking*, where accidents and contingencies play an enormous role. 
		- e.g. bird feathers were originally to keep them warm, then used to help them fly
		- e.g. maybe language itself developed as a strictly social tool, then hijacked as a means of reasoning, making human consciousness itself a product of an accident 
	- What constitutes true creativity is the openness and adaptability of the spirit, looking at something through different angles 
- Dimensional thinking p242
	- We normally work with abstractions and simplifications, reducing highly complex and interactive problems into modules, formulas, tidy statistics. This yields only a partial picture of reality, and miss the living, breathing element. 
	- You want to instead not be in a hurry, preferring the 'holistic approach'. Look at the object of study from as many angles as possible, giving your thoughts added dimensions. Assume that the parts of any whole interact with one another and cannot be completely separated. Get as close to the complicated truth and reality of your object of study as possible
	- Career wise what does this mean? Is this an argument to go as detailed as possible rather than breadth? But also, in my job, I'm looking at the issue 'from as many angles as possible', so that's not a bad thing. 
- Alchemical creativity and the unconscious p242
	- The idea of alchemy: *interaction of opposites* - by reconciling opposites, the alchemist believes he can discover the deepest secrets of nature, gain the power to create something out of nothing, and turn dust into gold 
	- Our culture depends in many ways on the creation of standards and conventions we must all adhered to. These conventions are often expressed in terms of *opposites*, like good and evil, etc. These opposites give our world a sense of cohesion and comfort. But life is more fluid and complex than that; hard to fit all desires and experiences into these tidy categories
	- Thinking of everything in black and white / opposites limits our creativity. Explore the unconscious and contradictory parts of your personality
	- Contradictions contain a rich mine of information about reality that is deeper and more cmplex than immediately perceived 

### VI: Fuse the Intuitive with the Rational: Mastery 
- p265 We must do what we can to cultivate a greater memory capacity - one of the most important skills in our technologically oriented environment
	- We should not simply look for entertainment and distractions in our spare time. Instead take up hobbies - a game, musical instrument or foreign language - that bring us pleasure but also offer us the chance to strengthen our memory capacities and flexibility of our brain. We can train ourselves to process large amounts of information without feeling anxious or overtaxed 
	- 2022.08.26 Chess is a 'game' that trains my memory although it is perhaps not directly transferrable. But at least it is fun and instils discipline lol. A good form of relaxation... #thought 
	- 2022.08.26 Reading and summarising books also is another type of 'hobby'... 
- Seems to be an argument for [[B_Range]] and the interconnectedness of different subjects, etc. All these require some form of intuition 
- *The brain of a Master is so richly interconnected that it comes to resemble the physical world, and becomes a vibrant ecosystem in which all forms of thinking associate and connect. This growing similarity between the brain and complex life itself represents the ultimate return to reality*
- Need intense focus
