Gregory Hayes translation 
- 2.5 Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on **doing what's in front of you with precie and genuine seriousness**, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on **freeing yourself from all other distractions**. Yes, you can - if you **do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life**, and stop being aimles, stop letting your emotions override waht your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self centered, irritable. You see **how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life?** If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you. 2022.09.10
