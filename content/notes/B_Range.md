Date summarised: 2021.10.03 (simple)
> [!tldr] The book in 3 sentences
> - In a world of hyperspecialisation, having range / being a generalist is still useful because this world is a [wicked environment](notes/C_Wicked%20environments.md), not a kind one
> - Head starts are overrated, and it is okay to meander along with experimentation (but knowing when to quit)
> - Deliberately making time to learn something outside your domain regularly could pay off one day, even if it may not seem apparent today, when you can connect the dots across domains 
## Application
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*
2021.10.03
- My current role: too general or too specialised? To stop overthinking about these matters, one day these things learned will be useful somewhere else. 
- I have already 'specialised' by finishing all my actuarial exams, so now it is okay to go a bit more general and see what else is out there in this world 
- This awareness of the importance of range and going beyond your domain could be a useful competitive advantage / edge compared to those who are solely focused on specialising / technical skills 
- To really 'succeed' as a specialist, probably must be a superstar and right at the top, but with a more generalist slant, can combine a few things to find your own path to success 
- How does this correlate with [[B_So Good They Can't Ignore You]] advice? 

## Top 3(+) quotes
- Our greatest strength (as humans as opposed to computers) is the exact opposite of narrow specialisation. It is the ability to integrate broadly

## Summary + Notes

#### 1: Cult of the Head Start
- **Head starts are only relevant for "kind" environments (which are the exception), not "wicked" ones**
- Chess, golf, firefighting are the exceptions, not the rule
- "Kind" vs "wicked" learning environments: the world is a wicked environment 
- Our greatest strength (as humans as opposed to computers) is the exact opposite of narrow specialisation. It is the ability to integrate broadly 

#### 2: How the wicked world was made 
- **The modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. The rest can be more easily automated**
- Econ majors do well: since economics is a broad field by nature
- Detailed prior knowledge is less important than a way of thinking 
- The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be **automated**, while great rewards will accrue to those who can **take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one**.

#### 3: When less of the same is more 
#### 4: Learning, fast and slow
- ==Desirable difficulties as opposed to rote / traditional learning - in support of Range==
-  [[Generation effect]]: one of the [[C_Desirable difficulties]] - struggling to generate an answer on your own can enhance learning, even if it was (wildly) wrong, and enhances subsequent learning. 
- [[C_Learning is most efficient in LT when inefficient in ST]]
- [[Interleaving]]: another one of the [[C_Desirable difficulties]]
- The most successful **problem solvers** spend mental energy **figuring out what problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it**, rather than jumping in with memorised procedures 
- Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems 

#### 5: Thinking outside experience 
- ==Deep analogical thinking and across different contexts/domains - an argument for Range==
- Kepler is a good example of thinking entirely outside his domain 
- **Deep analogical thinking** is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. It is a powerful tool for **solving wicked problems**
- **Thinking relationally** is the key to humans' success, an extension of just depending on [[C_Direct experience]]
- In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.
- All forces align to incentivize a head start and early, narrow specialization, even if that is a poor long-term strategy.

#### 6: The trouble with too much grit 
- ==Concept of [[C_Match quality]], and knowing when to quit==
- For professionals who did switch, whether they specialized early or late, **switching was a good idea**. “You lose a good fraction of your skills, so there’s a hit,” Malamud said, “but you **do actually have higher growth rates after switching.**” Regardless of when specialization occurred, switchers capitalized on experience to identify better matches.
- The expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. **It is ideal.** They have **less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward**, and that have high informational value.
- Winners quit fast and often when they detect that a plan is not the best fit, and do not feel bad about it
- **Knowing when to quit** is a huge strategic advantage. Just must know when switching is simply a failure of perseverance, or astute recognition that better matches are available
- **"Olympic athletes need to understand that the rules for life are different from the rules of sports"** - same for me, exams (single overarching goal) vs facing the wider world; must "devote time to something that has no clear end goal"
#### 7: Flirting with your possible selves
- ==Dark Horses and their winding path to success - we have many selves and we do not stay the same; these selves are discovered through 'living' and not theory==
- Keeping your mind wide open will take **something from every new experience**
- **Dark horses**: those who take a winding path to be 'successful' - much more common than we'd expect. They were told 'getting off their initial path was so risky'
	- They look for **match quality** and **not whether they are going to fall behind**
- Because **[[C_We do not stay the same over time|personality changes more than we expect with time, experience, and different contexts]]**, we are **ill-equipped to make ironclad long-term goals** when our past consists of little time, few experiences, and a narrow range of contexts. Each **“story of me” continues to evolve.**
- Career goals that once felt safe and certain can appear ludicrous when examined in the light of more self-knowledge. Our work preferences and our life preferences do not stay the same, because **we do not stay the same**
- We learn who we are only by living, and not before 
- "Virtually every good thing in my life I can trace back to a misfortune... **[[C_There is good in everything, if only we look for it|You don't know what's good and what's bad when things happen]]**... You have to wait to find out"

#### 8: The outsider advantage 
- ==Being able to connect the dots as an outsider==
- "Knowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things, but it also makes you blind to other things that you could do."
- The more information specialists create, the more opportunity exists for curious dilettantes to contribute by **merging strands of widely available but disparate information—undiscovered public knowledge**, as Don Swanson called it. The larger and more easily accessible the library of human knowledge, the more chances for inquisitive patrons to make connections at the cutting edge.

#### 9: Lateral thinking with withered technology 
- ==Lateral thinking; aim to be T-shaped, or even π-shaped, instead of a narrowly focused specialist (fewer may suffice in this world). Also, frogs vs birds analogy==
- **Lateral thinking**: reimagining of information in new contexts, including drawing together seemingly disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses
- Dyson: **Birds** (big picture thinkers, see further) vs **frogs** (deeper). Need both birds and frogs, but now science is full of frogs 
- For narrowly focused specialists in technical fields, they are still absolutely critical, but their work is widely accessible, so fewer suffice. Also, there are massively increased opportunities for **connectors and polymathic innovators**, combining things in new ways and being broader than a specialist
- **T-shaped person**: one who has more breadth than an I shaped person. **T people can go to the I people with ==questions== to create the trunk for the T**
- Even more extreme: “π-shaped people” who dive in and out of multiple specialties. “Look for wide-ranging interests,” they advised. “Look for multiple hobbies and avocations"

#### 10: Fooled by expertise 
- ==[[C_Foxes v hedgehogs]] (from [[B_Superforecasting]]): foxes do well in wicked environments ,where experience alone does not improve performance==
- **Hedgehog** experts were deep but narrow... they fashioned tidy theories of how the world works through the single lens of their specialty, and then **bent every event to fit them**. Outcomes did not matter; **they were proven right by both successes and failures**, and burrowed further into their ideas. It made them **outstanding at predicting the past, but dart-throwing chimps at predicting the future**. 
- The foxes, meanwhile, “draw from an eclectic array of traditions, and accept ambiguity and contradiction,” Tetlock wrote. Where hedgehogs represented narrowness, **foxes** ranged outside a single discipline or theory and embodied breadth.
- In an impressively unsightly image, Tetlock described the very best forecasters as **foxes with dragonfly eyes**. Dragonfly eyes are composed of tens of thousands of lenses, each with a different perspective, which are then synthesized in the dragonfly’s brain.
- Foxes see complexity in what others mistake for simple cause and effect. They understand that **most cause-and-effect relationships are [[C_Probabilistic vs deterministic|probabilistic, not deterministic]]**. There are unknowns, and luck, and even when history apparently repeats, it does not do so precisely. They recognize that they are operating in the very definition of a wicked learning environment, where it can be very hard to learn, from either wins or losses.
- In **wicked domains that lack automatic feedback, experience alone does not improve performance**. ==Effective habits of mind== are more important, and they can be developed.
#### 11: Learning to drop your familiar tools 
- There are ==no tools that cannot be dropped, reimagined, or repurposed== in order to navigate an unfamiliar challenge. Even the most sacred tools. Even the tools so taken for granted they become invisible.

#### 12: Deliberate amateurs
- ==Deliberately make time to read something outside your domain frequently. Hyperspecialisation is a well-meaning drive for efficiency, but inefficiency needs cultivating too, and can pay off==
- “Do we really need to go through courses with very specialized knowledge that often provides a huge amount of stuff that is very detailed, very specialized, very arcane, and will be totally forgotten in a couple of weeks? Especially now, when all the information is on your phone. **You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning**.”
- an official with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission learned I was writing about specialization and contacted me to make sure I knew that specialization had played a critical role in the 2008 global financial crisis. “Insurance regulators regulated insurance, bank regulators regulated banks, securities regulators regulated securities, and consumer regulators regulated consumers,” the official told me. **“But the provision of credit goes across all those markets. So we specialized products, we specialized regulation, and the question is, ‘Who looks across those markets?’ The specialized approach to regulation missed ==systemic issues.==”**
- The interface between specialties, and between creators with disparate backgrounds, has been studied, and it is worth defending.
- work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then **more likely in the long run to be a smash hit** in the library of human knowledge.
 - “I always advise my people to ==**read outside your field, everyday something**==. And most people say, ‘Well, I don’t have time to read outside my field.’ I say, ‘No, you do have time, it’s far more important.’ ==Your world becomes a bigger world, and maybe there’s a moment in which you make connections.”==
- **At its core, all hyperspecialization is a well-meaning drive for efficiency**—the most efficient way to develop a sports skill, assemble a product, learn to play an instrument, or work on a new technology. But **inefficiency needs cultivating too**. The wisdom of a Polgar-like method of laser-focused, efficient development is limited to narrowly constructed, kind learning environments.

#### CONCLUSION: Expanding your range
- ==Wicked problems: you must tolerate the highest highs and the lowest lows. Learn and adjust as you go, and even abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely if needed. There is nothing inherently wrong with specialisation, but mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated==
- “Baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four.” In the wider world, “every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.” It doesn’t mean breakthrough creation is luck, although that helps, but rather that it is hard and inconsistent. **Going where no one has is a wicked problem. There is no well-defined formula or perfect system of feedback to follow. It’s like the stock market that way; if you want the sky highs, you have to tolerate a lot of lows.**
- Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to **learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely** should the need arise.
- Finally, remember that **there is nothing inherently wrong with specialization**. We all specialize to one degree or another, at some point or other. My initial spark of interest in this topic came from reading viral articles and watching conference keynotes that offered early hyperspecialization as some sort of life hack, a prescription that will save you the wasted time of diverse experience and experimentation. I hope I have added ideas to that discussion, because research in myriad areas suggests that ==mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated==. As Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a century ago, of the free exchange of ideas, “It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.”
