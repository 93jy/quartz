## Highlights
##### [[C_Craftsman mindset vs passion mindset]]
Different approaches to thinking about work: the **craftsman** mindset, a focus on what **value *you’re* producing** in your job, and the **passion** mindset, a focus on what **value *your* job offers you**. Most people adopt the passion mindset, but I argue that the craftsman mindset is the **foundation for creating work you love.**

##### [[C_Deliberate practice]] 
In most types of work—that is, work that doesn’t have a clear training philosophy—most people are stuck. This generates an exciting implication. Let’s assume you’re a knowledge worker, which is a field without a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate **deliberate practice** into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better. That is, **deliberate practice** might provide the key to quickly becoming **so good they can’t ignore you**. To successfully adopt the [[C_Craftsman mindset vs passion mindset|craftsman mindset]], therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a dedication to **deliberate practice**. #important  

##### [[2_Time management]], [[C_Deep Work]]
When you look at Mike’s spreadsheet, you also notice that he **restricts the hours** dedicated to **required tasks that don’t ultimately make him better at what he does (eighteen hours)** *(i.e. admin tasks)*. The majority of his week is instead focused on what matters: raising money, vetting investments, and helping his fund’s companies (twenty-seven hours). Without this careful tracking, this ratio would be much different.

- A common thread: *the importance of ability*. The things that make a job great are rare and valuable. If you want them, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. *You must be good at something before you can expect a good job.*
- 2022.08.21 The issue is not choosing the wrong job but *doing the wrong things once you have the job*
- Ask how you are going to be useful - what can you do for your team, rather than what the team / company can do for you
## Rule #1: Don't follow your passion 
- It takes time to get good at anything. Don't 'judge all things in the abstract before you do them'
- There are many complex reasons for workplace satisfaction, but the reductive notion of matching your job to a pre-existing passion is not among them 
- The type of work alone does not necessarily predict how much people enjoy it 
- The happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but those who have been around *long enough to become good at what they do*. This contradicts the passion hypothesis which emphasises the immediate happiness that comes from matching your job to a true passion 
- *Passion is a side effect of mastery*. 
- The following rules show **how people really end up loving what they do** 

## Rule #2: Be so good they can't ignore you 
##### TLDR
2022.07.21 - finished summary of Rule #2
- Nobody owes you a good job. Don't worry about whether the job is 'just right'. Don't follow your passion, instead become a *craftsman*. This helps you accrue *rare and valuable skills, i.e. career capital*. 
	- You may not need elaborate plans for your career, just grab the opportunities and accrue as much career capital as possible
- To get this career capital, you need ***deliberate practice*** to (i) deliberately stretch abilities beyond comfort level and (ii) receive ruthless feedback on performance 
- Thoughts 2022.07.21: 
	- comforting to know that it's not the exact career you have, but what you make of it. And, *stop thinking what the job can do for you, but what you can do for the job / how to be useful*. And don't need to plan so closely what you want to be in your career, just focus on accruing the capital and the skills (with the documentation / intentionality...) and you will eventually get somewhere, with *patience* too. 
	- **Deliberate practice** - on paper sounds like a good idea, and can implement the time tracking (toggl) to be more *intentional* with time. But beyond that, the concepts of 'stretching abilities' and 'feedback' are quite fuzzy and may not be so easy to implement in a real work setting? 

##### Intro 
- Different approaches to thinking about work: the **craftsman** mindset, a focus on what **value *you’re* producing** in your job, and the **passion** mindset, a focus on what **value *your* job offers you**. Most people adopt the passion mindset, but I argue that the craftsman mindset is the **foundation for creating work you love.**
- **Hour tracking strategy**: Newport tracks the hours spent doing deep work on research problem... Turning his attention back to the quality of what he produces
- What's bad about the **passion mindset** 
	- Focusing only on what the work offers you makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it, leading to unhappiness 
	- More importantly, the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are *essentially impossible to confirm*. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to *keep you perpetually unhappy and confused*, which probably explains why Bronson admits, not long into his career-seeker epic What Should I Do With My Life? that “the one feeling everyone in this book has experienced is of missing out on life.”
> There's something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centred concerns about whether your job is 'just right', and instead put your head down and plug away at *getting really damn good*. **No one owes you a great career, you need to earn it**, and the process won't be easy.
- Put aside whether your job is your true passion, instead turn your focus toward being so good they can't ignore you.
- Jordan had a name for the worries about *what his friends are doing with their lives and whether his accomplishments compare favorably*: **“the cloud of external distractions.”** Fighting this cloud is an ongoing battle. Along these lines, Steve Martin was so unsure during his decade-long dedication to improving his routine that he regularly suffered crippling anxiety attacks. 
	- The source of these performers’ craftsman mindset is not some unquestionable inner passion, but instead something more pragmatic: It’s what works in the entertainment business. As Mark Casstevens put it, “the tape doesn’t lie”: If you’re a guitar player or a comedian, what you produce is basically all that matters. If you spend too much time focusing on whether or not you’ve found your true calling, the question will be rendered moot when you find yourself out of work.
	- This is relatable... basically fomo about what other people are doing in other seemingly more interesting industries, earning more than you, etc. 
##### The career capital theory of great work 
- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. 
- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your **career capital**. 
- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a *strategy well suited for acquiring career capital*. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.
- You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the **craftsman** mindset is focused on achieving exactly that goal. 
- The downside of the **passion** mindset is that it strips away merit. For passion proponents like Slim, launching a freelance career that gives you control, creativity, and impact is easy—it’s just the act of getting started that trips us up. *Career capital theory disagrees. It tells us that great work doesn’t just require great courage, but also skills of great (and real) value*. When Feuer left her advertising career to start a yoga studio, not only did she discard the career capital acquired over many years in the marketing industry, but she transitioned into an unrelated field where she had almost no capital.
##### THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET 
- The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by **developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable**.
	- Actuarial: it is a deep and technical field so this is not a concern 
- The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
	- Arguably so, but this is justifiable in any number of ways lol. 'Bullshit Jobs'
- The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.
	- Not currently, but things could change quickly 

##### Not having elaborate plans for your career: Mike Jackson
- He leveraged the craftsman mindset to do whatever he did really well, ensuring that **he came away from each experience with as much career capital as possible**. He **never had elaborate plans for his career**! Just sticking his head up to see who was interested in his newly expanded store of capital, then jumping at whatever opportunity seemed most promising 
- This guy also 'literally tracks every hour of his day down to quarter hour increments' to ensure his attention is focussed on activities that matter → toggl: can track down to the minute, but the thing is it must lead to *actionable insight* - am I actually focussing on the activities that matter after all this tracking? 
##### Chapter 7: Becoming a craftsman: [[C_Deliberate practice]] as the key strategy to acquire career capital, and how to integrate it into working life 
- Central idea of chapter: the difference in strategy that separates average guitar players from the best is not limited to music. This focus on **stretching ability and receiving immediate feedback** provides thee core of a more universal principle - the key to successfully acquiring career capital in almost any field 
- Deliberate practice is **not obvious**: outside fields like chess, music, sports, which have clear competitive structures and training regimes, few do anything remotely close to this. **If you just show up and work hard, you'll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.**
- Since it's not obvious for knowledge workers how to implement deliberate practice, **if you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life** you have the possibility of 'blowing past your peers in your value' as you're likely alone in your dedication to get systematically better. So this might be the key in becoming so good they can't ignore you. To successfully adopt the *craftsman mindset*, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a **dedication to deliberate practice**.
- ==**How to implement deliberate practice into a knowledge worker job?**== 
	- **Stretch your abilities** by *taking on projects beyond your current comfort zone* 
	- Obsessively seek direct **feedback** on *everything*
	- #actionable ==Mike Jackson example==
		- Mike maintains his dedication to stretching his ability, guided by feedback. His new tool of choice is a **spreadsheet**, which he uses to **track how he spends every hour of every day**. “At the beginning of each week I **figure out how much time I want to spend on different activities**,” he explained. “I then track it so I can see **how close I came to my targets**.” On the sample spreadsheet he sent me, he divides his activities into **two categories**: hard to change (i.e., weekly commitments he can’t avoid - like *admin*) and highly changeable (i.e., *self-directed activities that he controls*).
		- [[C_Being intentional|intentionality]]: Mike’s goal with his spreadsheet is to **become more “intentional” about how his workday unfolds.** “The easiest thing to do is to show up to work in the morning and just respond to e-mail the whole day,” he explained. “But that is *not the most strategic way to spend your time*.”
		- When you look at Mike’s spreadsheet, you also notice that he **restricts the hours dedicated to required tasks that don’t ultimately make him better at what he does** (eighteen hours - *admin work in my tracking*). The majority of his week is instead **focused on what matters**: raising money, vetting investments, and helping his fund’s companies (twenty-seven hours). **Without this careful tracking, this ratio would be much different**.
		- This is a great example of **deliberate practice at work**. “I want to spend time on **what’s important, instead of what’s immediate,**” Mike explained. At the end of every week he **prints his numbers to see how well he achieved this goal, and then uses this feedback to guide himself in the week ahead**. The fact that he’s been promoted three times in less than three years underscores the effectiveness of this deliberate approach. → maybe I should be even more neurotic about my toggl time tracking?? 

##### The 5 habits of a craftsman 
- Step 1: Decide the type of career capital market you're in: winner-takes-all vs auction. I'm definitely in an auction market. A collection of relevant skills that combined will give you career capital (many things matter and combine into a whole, instead of a winner-takes-all market like sports / entertainment where you need to be super good at just one thing, e.g. writing TV scripts)
	- In an auction market, you may not know exactly what you want to do, but you can set out to gain any capital relevant to this broad topic 
- Step 2: Identify your capital type 
	- A useful heuristic: seek *open gates* - opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. Easier to start from where you are than from scratch... That seems commonsense enough 
- Step 3: Define 'Good'
	- **You need clear goals** - if not it's hard to take effective action 
- Step 4: Stretch and destroy 
	- Deliberate practice is to push you past the plateau and into a realm with little competition. There is little competition because *it is often the opposite of enjoyable*.
	- If you're not uncomfortable, you're probably stuck at an 'acceptable' level. 
	- **Feedback**: the other half of the deliberate-practice story (other than pushing past what's comfortable). Honest feedback, *even if it destroys what you thought was good*.
- Step 5: Be patient 
	- Without the patient willingness to *reject shiny new pursuits*, you will derail your efforts before you acquire the career capital you need. 
	- Just stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and realising, 'Hey, I've become pretty good, and people are starting to notice'

## Rule #3 Turn down a promotion 
##### TLDR
2022.07.26 - finished summary of Rule #3. *More details (in the book's words): see below Summary of Rule #3. This is just my summary*
- Control is the 'dream job elixir', and the best place to invest the career capital acquired (Rule #2). 
- There are 2 control traps (pursuing too much control too early on, hard to pursue control later on when people demand your time). 
- The law of financial viability is an indicator on whether it's the right time to exercise the option for more control (solution to the control traps)
- Thoughts 2022.07.26 
	- I have not reached the point where I want more control in my career yet, or am looking to open a cafe on a whim for more control. So this chapter is not so relatable 
	- Was a bit confused by the 'law of financial viability'. But seems like this doesn't go against the exhortations to care less about money (e.g. [[B_Mastery]]) or be less materialistic. This is just an indication on *whether it's the right time to get more control*

##### Chapter 8: The dream-job elixir (control)
- ***Control** over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work you love* 
	- Control is one of the most universally important traits you can acquire with career capital - something so powerful and essential to the quest for work you love - the dream-job elixir
- You have to get good before you expect good work 
- Control is scientifically proven to be one of the most important in pursuing a happier, more successful, more meaningful life 
- 'Results only work environment' (ROWE): all that matters is results, not when you work / take leave / reply emails. Leading to employees liberated by control.
	- My real world experience in MR SS: still expected to show up and be online for impression management, so not so easy... 
- Summary: if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to *acquire career capital*. Next, *invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control* is one of the most important targets to choose for this investment of capital. 
##### Chapter 9: The first control trap 
- Dangerous to pursue more control before you have career capital to offer in exchange. Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable 
- This may not be so relatable for me because I'm not looking to quit my job to do something unconventional 
##### Chapter 10: The second control trap 
- Once you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, you have become valuable enough to your employer that they will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy 
- Some story about a freelance programmer enjoying control in her life... That's a bit out of touch and not realistic either 
- The *irony of control*: when nobody cares what you do with your working life, you probably don't have enough career capital to do anything interesting. But once you do have this capital, you've become valuable enough that your employer will resist your efforts. 
- The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change 
- Getting the dream job elixir (control): knowing when to do it is difficult because of the 2 control traps (both scenarios feel the same)
	- Possible that you don't have enough career capital to back up this bid for more control (first control trap) → then you shouldn't pursue more courage now
	- Possible that you have plenty of career capital, and the resistance is exactly because you're so valuable (second control trap) → can pursue the idea 

##### Chapter 11: Avoiding the control traps 
- **The law of financial viability**: When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more **control** into your work life, seek evidence of **whether people are willing to pay for it**. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.
	- Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable. But this is **different from pursuing money for the sake of having money**. 
	- 2022.07.26: I'm trying to square this idea with my goal of being less materialistic. So ultimately, money is like 'good grades', and earning more means you are more valuable? 
		- I think this argument is more for people who are trying to introduce more **control** in their lives, since that is the subject of his earlier chapters - that control is the best thing you can buy with career capital. It's not about earning more to impress people / prove that you're worth it / etc. It's that it is an *indicator of whether you can afford to buy more control*
##### Summary of Rule #3
- Rule #1 dismissed the passion hypothesis, which was replaced with career capital theory in Rule #2: the traits that define great work are rare and valuable, and if you want these in your working life, you must first build up rare and valuable skills (career capital) to offer in return. How to obtain it: through deliberate practice (beyond comfort level + feedback)
- Rule #3: how to *invest* the career capital. Best to invest it in *control* (what you do / how you do it), the 'dream job elixir' as many who love what they do have a lot of it.
- 2 control traps: i) gaining more control without capital to back it up, ii) employers who fight to keep you on a more traditional path when you have more capital. Hard to distinguish one from another
- one way to distinguish: 'law of financial viability': unless people are willing to pay you, it's not an idea you're ready to go after 

## Rule #4 Think small, act big 
##### Chapter 12: The meaningful life of Pardis Sabeti
- *A unifying mission to your working life can be a source of great satisfaction*
- Pardis is some researcher who enjoys her job and has hobbies beyond her job. Her happiness comes from the fact that she built her career on a clear and compelling mission: something that not only gives meaning to her work but provides the energy needed to embrace life beyond the lab 
- **The power of mission**: to have a *mission* is to have a unifying focus for your career. It provides an answer to the question *What should I do with my life?*
	- Missions are powerful because they focus your energy toward a useful goal, which then maximises your *impact* on your world - a crucial factor in loving what you do 
	- People who feel that their careers truly *matter* are more satisfied with their working lives, and can *work harder*
- *How to make mission a reality in your working life?*
	- First need career capital (like control). But that's not sufficient. Read the following chapters. 

##### Chapter 13: Missions require capital 
- *A mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable*
- Big ideas are almost always discovered in the '*adjacent possible*', the adjacent space that contains possible *new combinations* of existing ideas. 
- **The capital-driven mission**
	- A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough: an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field. So to identify a mission for your working life, you must *first get to the cutting edge*, the only place where these missions become visible 
	- *First master a promising niche* (could take *years*), then turn your attention to seeking a mission. 
	- If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace. But it's rare, because such breakthroughs require you to first get to the cutting edge - which is hard and could take years 
	- *Career capital and getting to the cutting edge*: the process of getting to the cutting edge builds up rare and valuable skills (and career capital). Then identifying a compelling missions once you get to the cutting edge (another desirable trait for career) is like *investing* your career capital. So if you want a mission, you need career capital first. 
- **Summary**: Rule #4 is entitled “Think Small, Act Big.” It’s in this understanding of career capital and its role in mission that we get our explanation for this title. 
	- *Advancing to the cutting edge* in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to *focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time*. (to acquire career capital)
	- Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and *discover a mission in the adjacent possible*, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action.
- **Thoughts 2022.07.29**: may not be so applicable with my few years of experience, but good to keep in mind going forward: focus first, then dream about the big mission. The adjacent possible idea: finding a niche... I'm already in a niche, but this niche has many parts, and I could find a niche in the niche, which is what I'm slowly doing no ('promising niche'?)? Is it a rare and valuable skill? I think so, *people need this kind of thinking also beyond fin re*. And in newer (still financial-related) actuarial roles. This is less narrow than trad pricing
##### Chapter 14: Missions require little bets 
- Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using *small but achievable **projects** (**little bets**) to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.*
- **Just going in the right general direction**: 'no real vision of how it would prove useful'...
- A common strategy to successful innovators / companies: “Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance,” he writes, “they make *a methodical series of little bets about what might be a ==good direction==*, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins” [emphasis mine]. This rapid and frequent *feedback*, Sims argues, “allows them to find unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes.”
- These bets are bite-sized: you try one, it takes a few months at most, either succeeds or fails, but either way you get *important [[C_Feedback]] to guide your next steps*. [[B_The 12 Week Year]]
- This approach stands in contrast to the idea of choosing a bold plan and making one big bet on its success 
- Conclusion: **small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback**
	- Career capital: identify a compelling mission. 
	- The strategy of little bets: increase chances of succeeding in the mission 
- **Thoughts 2022.08.01**: this is encouraging, and reads better than the [[B_Essentialism#^1f21e9|oversimplification in Essentialism]] that you need a 5 year plan and purpose and his condescension at people who don't have 5 year plans for their careers. And gels well with the concept of quarterly planning ala [[B_The 12 Week Year]]. 

##### Chapter 15: Missions require marketing 
- Find projects that satisfy the law of remarkability: the idea must inspire people to remark about it 
- **The law of remarkability**: For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be **remarkable in 2 ways**
	- First, it must compel people who encounter it to *remark about it to others*
	- Second, it must be launched in a *venue that supports such remarking*
##### Summary of Rule #4
- Mission is one of the traits to use your career capital to buy 
- Law of remarkability: the mindset of a marketer 
- Little bets

## Conclusion
- ==**Rule #1 Don't follow your passion**==
	- If you want to love what you do, 'follow your passion' can be bad advice. It's more important to become good at something rare and valuable, then invest the career capital this generates into the type of traits (control and mission) that make a job great 
	- The Rule #1 mindset saved [the author] from needless fretting about which of these paths forward was my true calling. **If tackled correctly, I was absolutely confident that *either* could yield a career I love.**
- ==**Rule #2 Be so good they can't ignore you**==
	- The things that make great work great are rare and valuable. If you want them in your career, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. In other words, if you’re not putting in the effort to become, as Steve Martin put it, “so good they can’t ignore you,” you’re not likely to end up loving your work—regardless of whether or not you believe it’s your true calling.
	- The concept of **deliberate practice**—a method for building skills by ruthlessly stretching yourself beyond where you’re comfortable. As I discovered, musicians, athletes, and chess players, among others, know all about deliberate practice, but **knowledge workers do not**. Most knowledge workers avoid the uncomfortable strain of deliberate practice like the plague, a reality emphasized by the typical cubicle dweller’s obsessive e-mail–checking habit—for what is this behavior if not an escape from work that’s more mentally demanding?
	- If you’re not careful to keep pushing forward (**something like me now post-exams**), your improvement can taper off to what the performance scientist Anders Ericsson called an “acceptable level,” where you then remain stuck. The research driving Rule #2 taught me that these plateaus are dangerous because they cut off your supply of career capital and therefore cripple your ability to keep actively shaping your working life. So we need practical strategies in our working lives to **make deliberate practice a regular companion in the daily routine** 
	- **focusing my attention on a bottom-up understanding of my own field’s most difficult results would be a good first step toward revitalising my career capital stores.** → **Relatable - answer the questions in my Q&A bank, rather than just live each day email to email**
	- To combat this resistance, I deployed **two types of structure**. 
		- **Time structure:** “I am going to work on this for one hour,” I would tell myself. “I don’t care if I faint from the effort, or make no progress, for the next hour this is my whole world.” But of course I wouldn’t faint and eventually I would make progress. It took, on average, ten minutes for the waves of resistance to die down. Those ten minutes were always difficult, but knowing that my efforts had a time limit helped ensure that the difficulty was manageable.
		- **Information structure**: capturing the results of my hard focus **in a useful form**
	- **Research bible routine**: once a week, summarise a paper possibly relevant to his research. Includes the strain of **deliberate practice** #actionable 
	- **Hour-tally routine**: a clearly visible sheet of the total number of hours spent that month in a state of deliberate practice
		- By having these hour counts **stare him in the face every day**, he is **motivated to find new ways to fit in more deliberate practice** into the schedule. 
	- **Deliberate practice-inducing tasks are often sidestepped** (in a todo list) as the **ambiguous path to completion + mental strain** makes them an unpopular choice in scheduling decisions 
	- *Getting better and better at what you do requires the strain of deliberate practice. This is a different way of thinking about work, but once embraced, the changes to career trajectory can be profound*
- ==**Rule #3 Turn down a promotion**== 
- ==**Rule #4 Think small, act big**==
	- True missions require 2 things: career capital + ceaselessly scanning your always-changing view of the adjacent possible in your field, **looking for the next big idea. This requires a dedication to brainstorming and exposure to new ideas** 
	- Combined, these 2 commitments **describe a lifestyle, not a series of steps** that automatically spit out a mission when completed. This is a **3-level pyramid**
	- **Top level: tentative research mission**: rough guideline for the type of work interested in (e.g. actuaries and sustainability)
	- **Bottom level: background research**: every week, exposure to something new about the field. Add a summary, in your own words, to the growing **research bible** (rule #2 above) #actionable And I'm already actually doing this? 
		- Carve out one walk each day for **free-form thinking** about the ideas turned up by this background research 
	- **Middle level: exploratory projects**: little bets
		- Project small enough to be completed in less than a month 
		- Forces you to create new value (e.g. master a new skill)
		- Produces a **concrete result you can use to gather concrete feedback**
		- How to make this #actionable ? Q4 2022 project: paying money for the climate change course 2022.08.22 
- **==Working right trumps finding the right work==**
	- Free yourself from the escapist thoughts of fantasy jobs and instead focus on the tasks you are given and accomplish them well. Don't make the constant, draining comparisons between current work and magical future occupation #important 
	- You don't need the perfect job to find occupational happiness. You instead need a **better approach to the work** available to you right now. 
	- #thought Maybe it's all a mindset thing. If I really have faith and put more love into my job and reduce the negativity, naturally my work output and performance will increase, then I will love it even more in a virtuous cycle 2022.08.22
