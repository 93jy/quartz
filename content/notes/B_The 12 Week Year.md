[Books](notes/Books.md) #book [[BK_The 12 Week Year]]
Date summarised: 2021.08.05 - 2021.09.12
## The book in 3 sentences
- Use the 12 week year as your execution system to close the execution gap; it is the right length of time for planning 
- Intentionality in how your spend your time is key; working harder does not guarantee success, you must work on the right things 
- Ownership of your situation is the single most important thing - don't let your circumstances be an excuse
- The 12WY framework covers end-to-end process with 5 disciplines and 3 principles: from vision (fluffy thinking) to execution (planning, tracking, reviews)
## Overarching themes of the book
1. **Execution bias / closing the execution gap**: that's where the real difference lies (the single greatest market differentiator)
2. **Focus**: Being great at few things rather than mediocre at many
	- [[C_Periodisation]]
3. **Vision / emotional connection** with your goals: the bridge between dreams/values and execution
4. **[Intentionality](notes/C_Being%20intentional.md)** about what you do / how you spend your time is key 
5. **[Working harder does not correlate with more success](notes/C_Working%20harder%20does%20not%20correlate%20with%20more%20success.md)**: i.e. no need to fomo people who OT
6. **[[C_Personal accountability and ownership|Personal accountability / ownership]]**: single most important thing to do to become great 
- Quite a bit of overlap with [Cal Newport](notes/Cal%20Newport.md) advice
	- Values
	- Quarterly planning
	- Time block planning 
	- Intentionality on time use / working harder doesn't mean more success (don't work after 5pm, etc.)

## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*
After exams - need another way to focus on my work, maybe setting a 12WY plan will help keep me focused on something for the next 3 months. 
## Top 3(+) quotes
- Execution is the greatest single market differentiator (what you implement that counts) - this book is about closing the execution gap 
- Intentionality in how you spend your time - secret weapon in the war on mediocrity
- It’s important to realize the simple truth that you can’t do it all; otherwise you will continue to labor under the false belief that you will eventually catch up, and finally get to the important stuff
- And many more
