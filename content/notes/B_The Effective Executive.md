Date summarised: July 2021 / ending 2021.10.24 
## The book in 3 sentences
- **Effectiveness can be learned:** it is a habit, and it is an executive's job to be effective 
- **Know thy time**: time is the scarcest resource, so you need to control time management perpetually. [[Time block planning]]: to be effective, you need time in fairly large chunks. Also, **do one thing at a time**
- **Focus on results/contribution rather than efforts**: it is not about how much you OT, but what you are contributing 
## Impressions
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*
- A lot of overlap with other self help, notably time management: most crucial. Block your time. And do one thing at a time
- A lot of the stuff is higher level management stuff, I am not at that level yet. Probably I will relate to more of this in a few years more in my career? May be a bit abstract at this phase (2021)
- But at this point, I must remember the importance of time block planning / time management / single tasking (he encourages recording time, which I do religiously but *do not act on further* - perhaps I should see how I can **optimise based on my detailed toggl records**. And it's **not about how many hours you work, but on your work output (*be useful*)**
- Chapters 6-7 are for higher level decision makers 
## Top 3+ quotes
> **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 2 - Know Thy Time|Time management]]**
> **The supply of time is totally inelastic**. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it and no marginal utility curve for it. Moreover, time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday’s time is gone forever and will never come back. Time is, therefore, always in exceedingly short supply. **There is no substitute for time.** Yet most of the tasks of the executive require, for minimum effectiveness, **a fairly large quantum of time**. To spend in one stretch less than this minimum is sheer waste. One accomplishes nothing and has to begin all over again.

> **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 3 - What Can I Contribute|Focus on contribution]]**
> The great majority of executives tend to **focus downward.** They are occupied with **efforts** rather than with **results**. They worry over what the organization and their superiors “owe” them and should do for them. And they are conscious above all of the authority they “should have.” As a result, they render themselves ineffectual.
> 
> The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But **the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, “top management.”** He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.

> **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 5 - First Things First|Concentration: single tasking]]**
> If there is any one “secret” of effectiveness, it is **concentration**. Effective executives **do first things first and they do one thing at a time**. This is the “secret” of those people who “do so many things” and apparently so many difficult things. **They do only one at a time. As a result, they need much less time in the end than the rest of us.**

##### Finding patterns within the chaos (something like [[2_Mental Models]]. Also like [[B_Principles]])
Accept. Reject. Reply. Ignore. Invest. Harvest. Hire. It can feel like chaos, but the **most effective people find the patterns within the chaos**. In Drucker’s view, ***we rarely face truly unique, one-off decisions***. And there is an **overhead cost to any good decision**: It requires argument and debate, time for reflection and concentration, and energy expended to ensure superb execution. So, given this overhead cost, it’s **far better to zoom out and make *a few big generic decisions that can apply to a large number of specific situations*, to find a ==pattern== within—in short, to go from chaos to concept.**
# Action plan
The **action plan** needs to create a system for **checking the results against the expectations**. Effective executives usually build two such checks into their action plans. The first check comes halfway through the plan’s time period; for example, at nine months. The second occurs at the end, before the next action plan is drawn up. 

Finally, **the action plan has to become the basis for the executive’s time management**. ***[[C_Time is an executive’s scarcest and most precious resource]]***. And organizations—whether government agencies, businesses, or nonprofits—are *inherently time wasters*. **The action plan will prove useless unless it’s allowed to determine how the executive spends his or her time**.
