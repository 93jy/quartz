- 2022.09.10 A long rail against MBA programmes
	- They are not worth the money or the prestige, and the net ROI is perhaps negative / you take very long to recoup the costs. If that is true, then it is encouraging. The message perhaps is that **there is no silver bullet in life**. In the end, you need the real skills to show it, not just the networks / connections / brand name school. 
	- But it is easy to see the allure of trying to get a prestige MBA. The equation is complex and this is just the *against* points of getting an MBA (non-prestige MBAs are likely non-starters, prestige MBAs may add more value but this is also not a choice I have anyway - see next point)
	- If you can get into a top MBA programme, *then you very well can succeed without it*. Perhaps the best reason why it is not worth it. Trying is a waste of time. If I fail, then I donâ€™t get it. If I get in, I still can succeed without it. So both ways no need to go for an MBA.
