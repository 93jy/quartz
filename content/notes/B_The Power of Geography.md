## Summary + Notes
What I have been always doing
- Bipolar (US, Soviets) → unipolar (1990s US) → multipolar (now, the norm for most of human history) → bipolar (US, China) 
> *(pg. xiv)* **Geography is a key factor shaping what humanity can and cannot do**. Yes, politicians are important, but geography is more so... There has been a talk of a 'flat world' in which financial transactions and communications through cyberspaces have collapse distance, and landscape has become meaningless... But it is not the experience of most of the other 8 billion people on earth.

> *(pg. 5)* When it comes to foreign policy and defence, a country's starting point is not what it intends to do but what it is capable of, and that is often limited by geography. 
### Australia
2022.10.30 
- Much of it is uninhabitable desert; population is concentrated in the 3 main cities
- 'Australian character': started off with gold prospectors, developed a culture more direct than that in colonial Britain 
- Coal it has a lot of, and is big part of the economy that is unlikely to diminish so quickly 
- Defence strategy: navy, preparing for an invasion from the north 
- China: a difficult line between economic interests, defence strategy and diplomacy. China is by far its biggest trading partner
