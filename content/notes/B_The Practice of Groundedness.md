> 2022.09.17: Everyone around seems to be getting ahead with their lives, going to interesting places. But perhaps **everyone runs his/her own race** and there is no need to compare. Just showing up and 'trusting the process', with faith that eventually things would work out, is perhaps more effective than feeling fomo and unsettled by what others are doing. This is a timely reminder why [comparison](notes/C_The%20greatest%20killer%20of%20happiness%20is%20comparison.md) is a waste of time - people may seem to have struck it big (on LinkedIn or Instagram, at least) today but **everyone's big moment comes at different times**. So one really does not need to follow the **pace of others**. 

- Instant gratification 

> *(Loc 1147)* Cultivating patience serves as a buffer against getting caught up in frenetic energy and angst. It helps **offset the temptation to seek novelty always and constantly change course**. It invites us to **show up reliably and thoughtfully**, even when things appear to be moving slowly. It encourages us to **take a longer view,** to recognise when it's wise to let situations unfold in their own time 

> *(Loc 1161)* In so many areas of life - both personal and professional - we tend to zoom in and **view the present moment as all-encompassing**. It doesn't help that our **culture** reinforces this with an incessant focus on **speed and overnight progress**. But when we zoom out and realise that so many of the projects in our lives are nine-inning games, the perceived immediacy of whatever it is we are dealing with relaxes 

>*(Loc 1182)* Sometimes you need to pound the stone over and over again before it breaks. That doesn't mean your previous blows weren't working. The tension may very well be building and you just can't see it yet. A breakthrough might be right around the corner 

> *(Loc 1203)* While most people have a 'hot streak' in their career - a 'specific period during which an individual's performance is substantially better than his or her typical performance', the **timing** is somewhat unpredictable. It emerges randomly and **not associated with any detectable change in productivity**. The common thing: they all rest on a foundation of prior work, during which observable improvement was much less substantial. If they had given up, left their careers, or switched approaches too early, their breakthroughs would not have occurred

- This must be balanced against the opposite risk: spending too much time on something and knowing when to cut losses. [Range (book)](notes/B_Range.md) talks about [match quality](C_Match%20quality), which is *even* more important than grit

> *(Loc 1240)* **'Go slow to go fast'**: Humans suffer from what behavioural scientists call the [Commission bias](notes/C_Commission%20bias.md), or the tendency to err on the side of action over inaction. If we don't see results, we get impatient and feel a strong urge to do something - anything - to expedite our progress. But often the best thing we can do is *nothing* - staying the course, tweaking as we go, and letting things unfold in their own time. Instead of always thinking, 'Don't just stand there, do something', we should at least consider thinking 'Don't just do something, stand there'.
