### 4 - Be Patient and You'll Get There Faster
- *[Trusting the Process](notes/C_Trust%20the%20Process.md)*
- Instant gratification 
- Cultivating patience serves as a buffer against getting caught up in frenetic energy and angst. It helps **offset the temptation to seek novelty always and constantly change course**. It invites us to **show up reliably and thoughtfully**, even when things appear to be moving slowly. It encourages us to **take a longer view,** to recognise when it's wise to let situations unfold in their own time (Loc 1147)
- 'Go slow to go fast'
- In so many areas of life - both personal and professional - we tend to zoom in and **view the present moment as all-encompassing**. It doesn't help that our **culture** reinforces this with an incessant focus on **speed and overnight progress**. But when we zoom out and realise that so many of the projects in our lives are nine-inning games, the perceived immediacy of whatever it is we are dealing with relaxes (Loc 1161)
- Sometimes you need to pound the stone over and over again before it breaks. That doesn't mean your previous blows weren't working. The tension may very well be building and you just can't see it yet. A breakthrough might be right around the corner (Loc 1182)
- 2022.09.17 thoughts: Everyone around seems to be getting ahead with their lives, going to interesting places. But perhaps everyone runs his/her own race and there is no need to compare. Just showing up and 'trusting the process', with faith that eventually things would work out, is perhaps more effective than feeling fomo and unsettled by what others are doing. People may seem to have struck it big (on LinkedIn or Instagram, at least) but everyone's big moment comes at different times. So one really does not need to follow the pace of others.
