## The book in 3 sentences
## Impressions
- 2022.08.21: this may be a bit outdated and outrageous (crassly focusing on the pursuit of money), but it is probably a good self help book that is motivational that I could read in the morning to start my day... 
- 2022.09.01 looking at the **title** of the book - literally 'think and grow rich'. That's what this book is about. Thinking is enough to make you grow rich. So the book is a lot about the power of your mind / thoughts to help you attain some goals. 
- 2022.09.17 the style of writing similar to books from that era (How to Win Friends and Influence People?)... How to write so elegantly like this? 
## How the book changed me
*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*

## Summary + Notes
### 1 - The power of thought
- Perhaps linked to [[C_Priming]]. If you keep thinking about something, **you are more ready to pounce and see an opportunity** 
- Many of the most successful people: their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them
- **Our brains become magnetised with the dominating thoughts we hold in our minds**
	- Magnetise your mind with intense desire [for riches]... 
- 2022.08.25 An overly simplified message: just think about success and you will get it 
	- The danger of such books is that if you don't succeed, it becomes your fault... And that's not how it works in the real world. So many circumstances are still beyond your control, despite how desperately you want 'success'.

### 2 - Desire - the starting point of all achievement 
- **6 steps...**
	- Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire (be definite, not just 'plenty of money')
	- Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire 
	- Establish a definite date when you intend to possess this money 
	- Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, begin at once whether you are ready or not to put this plan into action 
	- Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire 
	- Read this written statement aloud, twice daily, morning and night. *As you read, see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money* 
- This is not just for the attainment of money but for any goal 
- All who accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of *dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning* before the acquired money 
- **If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance**
- Tolerance and an open mind are practical necessities for the dreamer. Those afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Let no one influence you to scorn the dreamer. 
	- And some survivorship biased listing of successful dreamers (Columbus, Copernicus...)
- The power of optimism, p31: **openmindedness is essential for belief. Closed midns do not inspire faith, courage or belief**. No more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. 
	- *So is there no downside to optimism?* It is free to be optimistic, and the mindset is much better than a pessimst one
	- Personal application: to have more belief in myself,  one thing I am lacking. The confidence that if I keep doing what I'm doing, I will succeed and 'go far'. The belief that I have 'potential', so stop doubting and overthinking from the detractors, and the distractions from other careers.

### 3 - Faith - visualising and believing in the attainment of desire
- 2022.09.01 thoughts 
	- The text is in my opinion hyperbolic but still there are things to learn from it, especially applicable for an overthinker like me. Just have the right positive thoughts, have some faith, and see where that leads. Optimism is free after all (or perhaps not, if it leads to foolish life choices)
	- Just a good reminder that you are what you think, and wishy-washy 'faith' and 'emotion' play a big part also
- How to develop faith 
	- Making repeated affirmations to your subconscious mind is the only known method of developing the emotion of faith voluntarily 
	- 'All thoughts which have been emotionalised (given feeling) and mixed with faith begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart'
	- More talk about [locus of control](notes/C_Locus%20of%20control.md): people believe they are doomed to poverty and failure because of some some strange force over which they *believe* they have no control 
	- *'Deceiving' your subconscious mind: there is nothing wrong with that*. Behave as if you were already in possession of the material thing you are demanding. 
	- One may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. 
- Faith is a state of mind which may be induced by autosuggestion
	- Some outrageous statements about faith p49
	- It is a well-known fact that one comes, finally, to believe whatever one repeats to oneself, *whether the statement is true or false*. Repeat a lie over and over and it will become true 
	- Each of us is what we are because of the dominating thoughts we permit to occupy our minds. 
	- Any idea, plan or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought. So write out a statement of your major purpose ('Definite Chief Aim'), commit it to memory and repeat it - in audible words, day after day - until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind 
	- Memorise and repeat some positive statements to gain self confidence...
- Self confidence formula 
	- Concentrate thoughts for 30 min daily upon the task of thinking of the person you intend to become, creating in your mind a clear mental picture of that person. 30 min??
	- Devote 10 min daily to demanding of yourself the development of self-confidence 
	- Write down a description of 'Definite Chief Aim' in life, and develop self confidence you will attain it
	- 'All impulses of thought have a tendency to clothe themselves in their physical equivalent'
- The poem that was always in my room finds itself in the book, p55 (describing the law of autosuggestion) - so parents were not entirely wrong about this after all these years 
	- **Life's battles don't always go to the stronger or faster man, but soon or late the one who wins is the one who thinks he can**



### 4 - Autosuggestion - the medium for influencing the subconscious mind ([Mindset](notes/C_Mindset.md))
[Locus of control](notes/C_Locus%20of%20control.md), [[C_Thinking regulates actions]]
- **My summary** 2022.08.21
	- You have control over your thoughts that you allow into your subconscious, and the thoughts that enter your subconscious are very powerful.
		- *Autosuggestion is the **agency of control** through which an individual may voluntarily feed the subconscious mind thoughts of a creative nature or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind*
	- Have **faith**, even a childlike one (the most powerful of emotions), that this autosuggestion thing would work. Don't wait for a definite plan to let your subconscious mind think you have the money (or whatever)
	- Concentrate on your desire until it becomes a burning obsession
- **2022.08.21 thoughts** In the past this seems like nonsense, but perhaps now I am more appreciating the message that the **thoughts I have really control a big part of what I really experience**. A lot of the game is mental, given my very strong propensity to #overthinking
	- There is still quite a bit of nonsense ('Where failure is experienced, it is the individual, not the method, which has failed') but some parts ring truer to me now based on my current life experiences 
	- Have not read the other chapters of the book as was interested in this one as I realised the negative thought loops in my head. But this book keeps talking about having a fixed $ target in your mind and to let that seep into your subconscious. The unabashed pursuit of money seems a bit crass and makes me uncomfortable. How can I go to bed each night saying aloud 'I will have $xx million by 20xx' LOL. Is that the sure path to riches? 
- **No thought** (whether negative or positive) **can enter the subconscious mind without the aid of the principle of autosuggestion**
	 - All sense impressions which are perceived through the 5 senses are stopped by the *conscious* thinking mind, and may either be passed on to the subconscious mind or rejected at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as the outer guard to the approach of the subconscious. 
- You must communicate the object of your desire directly to your subconscious mind in a spirit of absolute **faith**. Your subconscious mind recognises and acts *only upon thoughts that have been well mixed with **emotion or feeling***. Plain, unemotional words do *not* influence the subconscious mind. The words must be well emotionalised with **belief**. 
- You must be able to concentrate upon a given *desire* until that desire becomes a *burning obsession*
- **Do not wait for a definite plan** through which you can earn the money. Begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, *demanding and expecting* meanwhile that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan. When they arrive, this inspiration may be considered a direct message from Infinite Intelligence. 
- **Faith is the strongest and most productive of the emotions. Have the faith of a child.**
- Some extreme instructions on reciting the thing you want right before bed and having the faith that it would come true someday (p74)
- [In caps] *Read the entire chapter aloud once every night, until you become thoroughly convinced that the principle of autosuggestion is sound, that it will accomplish for you all that has been claimed for it*
