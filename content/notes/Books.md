I read quite a number of books, perhaps too many falling under the category 'self development'. Although nobody is going to read these pages, having them publicly available psychologically forces me to maintain a certain minimum standard if they are to find their way online.

### Thoughts
- [ ] Perhaps a one line summary of each book would be helpful
- The urge to summarise books or add content to this page takes away the joy of reading. How to find the balance? 2022.09.17
