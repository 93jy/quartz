Concepts 
- Reading 4
	- EAR and stated return etc. 
		- Continuously compounded rate ('stated rate')
			- EAR x -> CC rate: x -> ln x
			- CC rate y -> EAR: y -> e^y - 1
		- Discretely compounded rate ('stated rate')
			- EAR x -> DC rate: x -> n ((1+x)^(1/n) - 1)
			- DC rate y -> EAR: (1 + y/n)^n - 1
		- 'Stated rate': the rate in semiannual/quarterly/CC etc. 
		- EAR: the 'actual' rate annualised. 
		- EAR > stated rate. 
		- If a stock doubled over the year, the EAR is 2. The CC stated rate is ln2 = 0.69. The quarterly stated rate is 4((1+2)^0.25 - 1) = 1.26 (correct?)
