A key concept in [[C_Deep Work]], etc. 
Life must be led with intentionality for it to be meaningful/fulfilling.

[So Good They Can't Ignore You](notes/B_So%20Good%20They%20Can't%20Ignore%20You.md): example from Mike Jackson, venture capitalist. He plans his time meticulously and tracks them into admin / non-admin time
