[[B_Your Brain At Work]]

There appears to be **real limits to the amount of information that can be held in the prefrontal cortex at any one time**. But what about when you try to do something with information on the stage, such as make a decision between two actors? An entire field of study, called relational complexity, explores this question. Relational complexity studies show over and again that **the fewer variables you have to hold in mind, the more effective you are at making decisions**. 

Another corollary: [[C_Periodisation]] (from [[B_The 12 Week Year]])
- by focusing every 12 weeks on something ("overload on a specific skill or discipline") 
- A season for everything
