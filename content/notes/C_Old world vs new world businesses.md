2 ways to succeed: 
First is to **take the cash flow from the old world business, and invest it into new world businesses**. Think Softbank using cash flow from the Telco business to invest into Alibaba. Or Reliance Jio building platforms in India.

The second is **operational excellence**. Deliver the **exact same product as the other guy, but better, faster, and cheaper**. To the point where your customers love you and will never leave.

Most businesses will end up in either one of these paths.
