From [[B_The Slight Edge]]
Definition: the little things add up. Compound interest

Like compound interest, the 2 slight edge curves (success and failure curve) run parallel to each other for a long time. Then all of a sudden they veer away from each other. So it takes a long time, just must have faith and trust the process. 

Seemingly insignificant actions, *easy to do and easy not to do*

**Positioned for success** ([[Farnam Street]]): just doing the incremental things that in the moment don't seem to add too much but one day would pay off. Something like behind an 'overnight success' is years of hard work. Concept of 'increasing your [[C_Luck]]'
