# Some reasons why comparison is counterproductive
- [[BA_Good Life_14 Fame]]
	- People are unhappy because they are **confused about what is valuable**. Hence, they pursue the wrong things that make them anxious and miserable. Fame is one such thing
	- **If we seek social status, we are giving other people power over us**, since we must do things that cause them to admire us 
	- To improve our quality of life, we should therefore aim to become **indifferent to others' opinions of us**
	- **Immortal fame** (seeking to be remembered after we die) is a pathetic thing; since we're dead, we wouldn't even be able to enjoy it. We should just make the best of today 
	- Realise that many other people (including closed ones) want you to fail in your undertakings 
- [The Practice of Groundedness: 4 - Be Patient and You'll Get There Faster](notes/B_The%20Practice%20of%20Groundedness.md#4%20-%20Be%20Patient%20and%20You'll%20Get%20There%20Faster)
	- Everyone around seems to be getting ahead with their lives, going to interesting places. But perhaps **everyone runs his/her own race** and there is no need to compare. Just showing up and 'trusting the process', with faith that eventually things would work out, is perhaps more effective than feeling fomo and unsettled by what others are doing. This is a timely reminder why **comparison** is a waste of time - people may seem to have struck it big (on LinkedIn or Instagram, at least) today but **everyone's big moment comes at different times**. So one really does not need to follow the **pace of others**.
