- [[BA_Good Life_14 Fame]]: 
	- People are unhappy because they are **confused about what is valuable**. Hence, they pursue the wrong things that make them anxious and miserable. Fame is one such thing
	- ==**If we seek social status, we are giving other people power over us**==, since we must do things that cause them to admire us 
	- To improve our quality of life, we should therefore aim to become ==**indifferent to others' opinions of us**==
	- **Immortal fame** (seeking to be remembered after we die) is a pathetic thing; since we're dead, we wouldn't even be able to enjoy it. We should just make the best of today 
	- Realise that many other people (including closed ones) want you to fail in your undertakings
