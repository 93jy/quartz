## From [The Effective Executive](notes/B_The%20Effective%20Executive.md)
> All effective executives **control their time management perpetually**. They not only keep a **continuing log** and **analyze it periodically**. They **set themselves deadlines** for the **important activities,** based on their judgment of their **discretionary time.**

> **Time is the scarcest resource**, and **unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed**. The **analysis of one’s time**, moreover, is the one easily accessible and yet systematic way to analyze one’s work and to think through what really matters in it. “Know Thyself,” the old prescription for wisdom, is almost impossibly difficult for mortal men. But everyone can follow the injunction **“Know Thy Time”** if he wants to, and be well on the road toward contribution and effectiveness.
