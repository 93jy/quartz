- You will not be able to 'do it all' - being a workaholic has [[C_Diminishing returns]]. Thinking that working harder will give you proportionally greater rewards will *limit what you can accomplish in life*
- Hence, the solution is to [intentionally](notes/C_Being%20intentional.md) prioritise the [[C_Important vs urgent tasks|important but not urgent]]. The way you allocate your time is more important than *how much time you have*
- ==What this means for me==: I cannot be a workaholic given health / eyesight / sleep problems, but **I should not let that limit my ambitions**, since the number of hours of working does not neatly correlate with 'success'. So excuses like health / eyesight / sleep problems are a cop out
- At the same time, we should not glamorise overwork. There is nothing to be fomo about any colleagues who work till 12 every day.
