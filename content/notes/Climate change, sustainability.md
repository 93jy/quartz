## Concepts
- What is the problem: carbon emissions → higher temperatures → many effects
- [Carbon pricing](notes/Carbon%20pricing.md)
- Who foots the bill: wealthy or developing nations?
	- how do wealthy nations subsidise the poor ones 
- [Tipping point](notes/C_Tipping%20point.md): the change can come all at once, we don't know if we have reached that point yet
- Delay in results
	- releasing carbon into the atmosphere - effects would only be seen in the future
- Irreversibility of changes 
	- once done, cannot reverse the damage - carbon released into the atmosphere would have impacts (i.e. even if we stop now, we would still experience the effects)
- Investing 
	- long term horizons
	- Not pricing it in valuations
	- Impairment of assets today (stranded assets) vs in the future when the actual assets are impaired 
	- [[Stranded assets]]
- Solutions: 
	- COP, other international conferences, etc. 
- This is a [wicked problem](notes/C_Wicked%20environments.md). Many concepts / mental models involved, far ranging 
- [Incentives](notes/2_Incentives.md) is most of it. Finance plays a big part in these incentives. 
- [Sustainability reporting](notes/Sustainability%20reporting.md)
- [Green bonds](notes/Green%20bonds.md)
