[_index](_index.md)

## Concepts
- What is the problem: carbon emissions → higher temperatures → many effects
- [[Carbon pricing]]
- Who foots the bill: wealthy or developing nations?
	- how do wealthy nations subsidise the poor ones 
- [[C_Tipping point]]: the change can come all at once, we don't know if we have reached that point yet
- Delay in results
	- releasing carbon into the atmosphere - effects would only be seen in the future
- Irreversibility of changes 
	- once done, cannot reverse the damage - carbon released into the atmosphere would have impacts (i.e. even if we stop now, we would still experience the effects)
- Investing 
	- long term horizons
	- Not pricing it in valuations
	- Impairment of assets today (stranded assets) vs in the future when the actual assets are impaired 
	- [[Stranded assets]]
- Solutions: 
	- COP, other international conferences, etc. 
- This is a [[C_Wicked environments|wicked problem]]. Many concepts / mental models involved, far ranging 
- [[2_Incentives|C_Incentives]] Is most of it. Finance plays a big part in these incentives. 
- [[Sustainability reporting]]
- [Green bonds](Green%20bonds.md)
