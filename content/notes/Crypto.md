### Ideas and thoughts (not for Notion)
- 2022.08.21 **What goes up must come down**
	- Really don't get drawn in by the hype, if ETH surges up, it will come down equally quickly, when will I learn this #lesson?

	- Interesting point on why the smart tech bros may be blind to any crypto 'fraud': they don't have the radar, because the startup industry is very illiquid - and fraudsters work best in liquid markets (which crypto is)
		- These are well-respected members of the community. I’ve met a few of them personally and have always come away impressed — by their goodwill as well as by their insights. What’s more, I must admit I’ve expressed similar sentiments about Bitcoin myself in private, during this latest bubble.
		- So what’s going on here? What could be blinding our community to fraud on such a scale?
		- Part of the answer, I believe, is **illiquidity**.
		- An _illiquid_ market is one you can’t cash out of quickly. The startup ecosystem is _very_ illiquid: it takes years to decades for founders to cash out of the businesses they build. Startup founders — and the VCs who back them — mostly have experience dealing in illiquid markets.
		- Crooks don’t like illiquid markets. Crooks like being able to cash out fast: the longer they stay in one place, the higher the chance they’ll be caught and arrested, because they are crooks.
		- Since illiquid markets repel crooks, the illiquid startup ecosystem turns out to be largely (though [not completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos)!) free from crooks. That’s part of what makes it such a pleasure to work in, but it also means that the community has never developed a great collective radar for fraud: it hasn’t needed one.
		- ==But the startup community has a _fantastic_ collective radar for things that 1) start small; 2) grow fast; 3) challenge the status quo; and 4) are broadly misunderstood. Those are the features of a promising startup! And the community has learned that it’s expensive to miss out on one of those.==
		- ==Unfortunately, those are also the features of a fraud==. But the startup community doesn’t encounter much fraud, so it tends to discount the possibility — and in crypto, that’s a grave mistake. Unlike startups, crypto is a _highly liquid_ market — exactly the kind that attracts crooks, and crooks like to do fraud. And that means that many things in crypto that look like promising startups, are actually frauds.
		- But it’s more than that: on top of everything else, crypto _really is_ a promising technology. [There’s value to decentralization](https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/) and censorship resistance; there’s value to trustless enforcement of [contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/); and there’s value to having a Schelling point for a scarce asset. The startup community is, correctly, recognizing that this potential value exists. But without good fraud radar, it has no way to estimate how much of that value is real _today_.
		- I believe the startup community is about to have its fraud radar recalibrated. That recalibration — and the exorbitant fee the market will charge for it — will be mandatory for anyone who holds a meaningful amount of crypto.
### Questions to answer 
2022.08.08 
- The promise of Defi: 
	- is the current financial system really so broken? Is it just a political argument to fix the current system with this permissionless system? 
	- 100% transparent and trustless. How to deal with KYC AML? 
2022.07.16
- The whole idea of smart contracts / code being law, and how that is superior to our normal law and contracts. e.g. when Celsius collapsed they paid off all the defi loans because they had to go by the code. I still don't completely buy it that this is better, what about more complex case by case situations? Not everything is so simple and black and white is it? If not why do we need lawyers? 
- Decentralisation / libertarianism: is it ultimately just a political ideology argument that all this decentralisation is good? Is decentralisation actually such a good thing - can human systems function when everything is democratised e.g. DAOs - may not be the most efficient way to get things done 
- What does crypto actually want to solve that isn't really working right now in the world?
- 'Monetary policy' and why everything is wrong with what the Fed is doing etc. It's not like such complex monetary policy issues can be reduced to codified smart contracts right? 
- What do people actually use crypto for right now? The defi aspect is mostly just for farming, staking, LP right? Do people actually use it for 'real world' purposes like take a loan for their house? If not it just seems to be an 'internal' economy and zero sum game kind of thing.

I will also add that Cardano will also be a strong L1 competitor in 2022. There are just a few things that need to be ironed out for Smart Contract scalability before dApps can fully flourish. Cardano update video incoming soon 👌🏻

Learn the basics of TA it is worth it - no it probably isn't 
- more like the terms and the average etc. 
- candlestick learn a bit can already - the patterns not so reliable 
- important one is engulfing candle, etc.

As with most things, the actual impact of crypto is likely to lie somewhere between completely revolutionising the world and completely evaporating. 


## Strategic Information Consumption
From Nat's Crypto Newsletter: Good Crypto Investing Decisions ('20-'22)
The amount of information flying around in crypto is overwhelming, almost cripplingly so. It is extremely hard to stay on top of everything, and you should not expect to. If you try, you’ll spend all day on Twitter and Discord and never get anything done. 

That ends up being a big problem because the more time you’re trying to consume info, the less time you’re building, and you’re much more likely to Make It from building stuff than reading stuff. **There’s very little alpha in public channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord**, so don’t spend all day hoping someone will leak something that makes you rich. It’s more likely that anything they’re sharing is to get you to be their exit liquidity. 

But it is **good to stay up on what’s going on**, so trying to be very deliberate about creating a focused information funnel is extremely useful. I was constantly churning and replacing sources of info until I could arrive at what gave me the most bang for my buck, with a healthy dose of fun mixed in. 

If you want the 80:20, here it is:
-   Bankless Podcast (weekly roundups mostly)
-   The [Daily (Ape / Bear)](https://substack.com/redirect/25e172c2-8582-46b8-bc4d-6893f48da528?u=71619930) Telegram channel
-   This [Twitter list](https://substack.com/redirect/e390a71d-2107-435f-8814-7e21862ded2b?u=71619930)

You could probably just follow those sources and you’d know 80-90%+ of everything you need to know about what’s going on. There are plenty of other great sources, and I don’t want to seem like I’m criticizing anyone else. But this will get you quite far if you want to minimize the number of things to stay on top of. 

Again, you are very unlikely to get some crazy life-changing alpha from following tons of people on Twitter or joining tons of Telegrams or Discords. Follow a few big sources of highly focused news, and then join a couple of very tight-knit communities where you are sharing stuff with friends, and focus your energy on doing stuff.
