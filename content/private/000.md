# To do 
- [x] Backlinks don't seem to show up 
- [x] How to make the repo private. Looks like that isn't possible. Then I just shouldnt have private notes here then. 
- [ ] How to link to _index

Terminal: Git commit stuff 
- use 'ls' to see what the directories are
- Usually it's just cd quartz
- Doing it once is enough 
- Then type the rest 

```shell
# Navigate to Quartz folder
cd <path-to-quartz>

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "message describing changes"

# Push to GitHub to update site
git push origin hugo
```

This will then push changes to the github directory...

git push origin hugo: if there is error, do 
Git pull
i
Write some message
Escape
:wq
Enter
Then git push origin hugo again
