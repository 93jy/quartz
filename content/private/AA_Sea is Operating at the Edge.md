# Sea is Operating at the Edge
https://www.generalist.com/briefing/sea
If you only have a few minutes to spare, here's what investors, operators, and founders should know about Sea Limited.

-   **A tough year**. It has not been a happy 2022 for Sea. The company lost $177 billion of its peak market cap, retreated from Europe and Latin America, and laid off staff. Losses swelled from $24.1 million to $506.3 million on an adjusted EBITDA basis. 
-   **Resembling Amazon**. Sea's shorthand during the last bull cycle was "Amazon for Southeast Asia." There's some validity in that comparison. Just as Amazon uses AWS's free cash flow to fund e-commerce growth, Sea relies on gaming division Garena to fuel Shopee's expansion. 
-   **The fate of *Free Fire***. Much of Sea's available cash comes from *Free Fire*, a battle royale game and global phenomenon. After dominating the charts for three years and grossing billions, *Free Fire*'s user base and bookings have started to fall. Sea will hope to arrest its slide. 
-   **Stabilizing Shopee**. Though Sea's e-commerce arm continues to lose money, there are signs of promise. Losses per order have improved from $0.41 to $0.33. In Shopee's most mature markets, it is operating close to break even. Sea will need to show a similar trajectory in Brazil, a newer market, to justify its presence.   **‍**
-   **The upside of SeaMoney**. Though a small part of Sea today, the fintech division SeaMoney could prove influential over time. With 70% of the Southeast Asian population either unbanked or underbanked, there's a significant need for a tech-forward financial institution. If Sea plays its cards right, it could build the region's version of Ant Financial.

One year ago, Sea Limited was on top of the world. The markets valued the Southeast Asian gaming and e-commerce conglomerate at more than [$200 billion](https://ycharts.com/companies/SE/market_cap), surpassing established peers like [Mercado Libre](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/meli). Gaming division Garena printed money thanks to the hit franchise *Free Fire*, while Sea's e-commerce division, Shopee, leveraged those earnings to devour share in cities on other sides of the world, including Jakarta, Rio de Janeiro, Ho Chi Minh, and Bogotá. The productive use of free cash flow drew favorable comparisons with Amazon and AWS, with Sea portrayed as a perfect market machine gathering speed in regions with potent secular tailwinds. 

The weather has turned against Sea over the past twelve months. Like other pandemic darlings and high-growth tech stocks, its valuation has plummeted, hovering around $26 billion. Layoffs have accompanied this market cap evisceration, with [3%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/sea-plans-to-fire-3-of-indonesia-staff-as-regional-cuts-begin?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google&sref=WesoLUpf) of Shopee employees dismissed in a recent round of departures. As its e-commerce division [retreats](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-09/sea-s-retail-arm-pulls-out-of-argentina-in-latin-america-retreat?sref=WesoLUpf) from markets like Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, global sensation *Free Fire *is also losing its luster, with declining active and paying users. Some think finding a replacement of similar magnitude may be difficult, given gaming's alchemic properties. 

Taken together, Sea appears to be at a crucible moment. It is an ambitious, innovatively structured organization facing mounting losses and moneyed competitors. Such dueling dynamics make predicting Sea's future a kind of financial Rorschach, encapsulating the observer's views on e-commerce penetration speed, China's technological stance, the repeatability of game development, and the intransigence of Alibaba. For one subject, the pattern of blots predicts a difficult future, defined by immoderate spending -- profitability is always a few years away. For another, the arrangement portends eventual supremacy, with the current interlude unpleasant but necessary.

The reason such disparate futures feel similarly feasible is a product of Sea's past. Since its founding in 2009, Sea has not been one company but many, sometimes simultaneously. The Singaporean outfit has evolved from scrabbling game publisher to dazzling hit machine to rabid shopping app to crafty neobank. It has been inventive and reductive, subtle and blunt. Just as the fantastical capitals of Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities* were all portrayals of Venice in the author's mind, Sea is a structure of compressed variation. From one year to another, one quarter to the next, the firm's emphasis can finely but meaningfully change. 

Sea's variability is not a consequence of flightiness or fuzzy thinking. Instead, it indicates the company's extreme pragmatism and CEO Forrest Li's talent for identifying what Sea needs at different stages of its maturation. Like a deft Formula One driver, Li seems to have an unusual skill for picking when to accelerate and when to pull back, when to attack and when to coast. His record suggests that Sea's 2022 may prove more blip than breakdown -- but there is not much room for error. Though it may not be able to move as aggressively as in the past, Sea is still in a cage fight with rivals, and even the most exuberant of investors cannot stomach endless losses. This is a company that gives the impression of constantly operating on the edge of its capabilities. 

In today's piece, we'll explore this aspect of Sea's nature. We'll also discuss: 

-   **The machine**. Sea is an unusual construction composed of gaming, e-commerce, and payments. While there are few synergies between these units organizationally or at the product level, there is a kind of economic harmony. 
-   **The state of play**. After a teeth-chattering ascent during the pandemic, Sea has fallen back to earth over the past twelve months. It now appears to be a business in flux, prioritizing profitability but burning aggressively. 
-   **The future**. Sea sits at the intersection of several growing markets. Favorable sectoral tailwinds and the company's formidable execution ability mean it may have plenty of room to grow. The key to capturing the opportunity will be improving e-commerce unit economics, layering on fintech revenue, and finding another gaming hit.

This piece draws on interviews with former and current employees, investors, and peers. Unless explicitly noted, all contributed on the condition of anonymity.


### Garena

It all started with Garena. 

In 2009, Forrest Li, Gang Ye, and David Chen started a company. All three were Chinese nationals based in Singapore with a shared love for gaming. Together, they decided to create a “global arena” for PC players, an aspiration that, when shortened, gave them their startup’s name: Garena.

Though universal in its aspiration, Garena gained strongest traction in Asian countries. Its “community for gamers” appealed to consumers looking for a simple platform to play popular PC games like _Call of Duty_ and socialize with other gamers. Within its first year, Garena registered [23 million](https://kr-asia.com/how-three-billionaire-founders-built-singapores-first-tech-unicorn-now-valued-at-usd-65b) users. 

Garena’s network optimization was critical to this success, enabling players in low-bandwidth countries to compete against those in more developed markets. In an earlier interview, Li emphasized the importance of this capability: “The feature can reduce latency and data loss for online gameplay and make it possible for a gamer from Singapore to play against a gamer from Vietnam.” An appreciation for the technical limitations of its target markets would become a trademark of Garena. 

The following year proved even more consequential, with Garena sealing a publishing partnership with Riot Games to distribute their games in the Southeast Asian market. Regional control over _League of Legends_ pushed the company to profitability within two years and cemented it as a trusted partner for other developers, winning the rights to franchises like _FIFA_. Tencent (Riot’s owner) promptly [invested](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisachanson/2015/03/27/garena-and-tencent-shine-a-light-on-southeast-asias-booming-digital-games-market/?sh=39b61dd74779) in Garena, eventually accumulating a [40% share](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/21/sea-closes-opening-day-on-nyse-up-8/). Garena also earned the rights to distribute Tencent's impressive catalog of games. 

The role of a publisher is a kind of stewardship. Companies like Garena are tasked with localizing and distributing different games, a challenge that requires local connections and expertise. The excellent series from the [Punch Card Investor](https://punchcardinvestor.substack.com/p/sea-ltd-part-1-garena-building-a) newsletter notes that Garena helped bring Southeast Asian footballers onto _FIFA_, for example. The publisher’s goal is to help a title thrive in local markets. 

In less ambitious hands, Garena might have continued on this trajectory, establishing itself as the preferred publisher in Southeast Asia, growing along with the broader industry. Forrest Li was not content with such an outcome, however. Recognizing that the developers of a successful game franchise earned considerably more than the publishers, Li targeted creating a franchise of his own.

Some developers toil for years before finding a hit. Slack and Discord famously stemmed from their founders’ failure to create a successful game, illustrating that the sector can stymie even outstanding entrepreneurs. Garena smashed it out of the park the first time it stepped up to the plate. In late 2017, Sea released its inaugural game: _Free Fire_. 

Garena was a very different company by then. Indeed, it had changed so much that it was no longer called Garena – or at least not only known by that name. After rolling out e-commerce and fintech divisions to supplement its gaming business (discussed later), the company renamed itself Sea Limited, reflecting its geographical focus and perhaps the vast opportunities ahead. It went public under that name in October 2017, debuting with a valuation of approximately $4 billion. Despite the significance of listing on the NYSE, hindsight tells us that _Free Fire_’s launch around the same time was the more important event. 

The game’s creation involved considerable strategy. The success of titles like _PUBG_ and _Fortnite_ made it easy for the Garena division to settle on a battle royale structure for _Free Fire_. Sea’s creativity came when considering the technical requirements of the product. Knowing Western games ran poorly on low-spec phones, Garena built _Free Fire_ to function well in environments with poor bandwidth. For social games, this is particularly important. As one gaming entrepreneur remarked, there’s a tendency to coalesce around the title that runs best on the worst device within a friend group. If your social circle is split between the U.S., Singapore, and Thailand, for example, and you all want to play a game together, you need one that works in Bangkok. _Free Fire_ was devised for this reality.

Free Fire

Though plenty of thought went into _Free Fire_, that doesn’t mean Sea didn’t hedge its bets. The company funded a handful of internal teams to build a game in the hopes of landing a hit. When they settled on _Free Fire_, they released it under the banner of “111dots Studio” in Vietnam, giving the company a chance to gauge consumer response without more extensive fanfare. 

“There was a sense it would do well,” one source said of Free Fire’s early days, “But not at the scale it did.” 

The following year, _Free Fire_ ignited, capturing share across Southeast Asia and beyond. Consumers appreciated the app’s performance in local environments, and the addictive social gameplay contributed to viral adoption. By the end of that year, _Free Fire_ had grossed [$118 million](https://sensortower.com/blog/garena-free-fire-revenue-q1-2019) and reached 60 million downloads. Management believed the game had global potential, but they had not forecast such rabid interest in Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil. _Free Fire_ ended the year as the [highest-grossing app](https://sensortower.com/blog/top-grossing-apps-brazil-for-2018) of the year in Brazil, besting stalwarts like Netflix, Tinder, and _Pokemon Go_. As we’ll discuss, Sea capitalized on this momentum aggressively with its e-commerce division. 

_Free Fire’s_ momentum steepened in 2019. It ended the year as the [most downloaded](https://dotesports.com/mobile/news/free-fire-beats-pubg-mobile-to-become-the-most-downloaded-mobile-game-of-2019) game in the world, besting the franchises it had emulated, including _PUBG_ and _Fortnite_. That year, it also crossed [$1 billion](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/72010/garena-battle-royale-free-fire-1-billion-dollars/) in lifetime revenue. The game would retain its title in 2020, though it was toppled the following year by _Subway Surfers_ despite logging [154 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/12/27/top-10-most-downloaded-apps-and-games-of-2021-tiktok-telegram-big-winners/?sh=1285219f3a1f) downloads. In 2021, it recorded an estimated [$830 million](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/top-grossing-games/#:~:text=Grossing%20Games%202021-,PUBG%20Mobile%20was%20the%20top%20grossing,2021%2C%20with%20%242.01%20billion%20revenue.) in revenue, enough to be the eighth-highest-earning app of the year. 

Despite being designed for lower-bandwidth environments, _Free Fire_ would even make inroads in the U.S. In Q1 of last year, it was the country’s top-earning game, pulling in $100 million. That put it ahead of _PUBG_, which led global revenue. Though more lucrative, a source remarked that the American user base has been particularly transient – departing the game at higher rates in recent months. Nevertheless, the fact that Garena pulled hundreds of millions out of a market it never planned to attack is symbolic of _Free Fire’s_ success. 

Over a decade ago, Sea began life as a community for gamers. Today, it is considerably more than that: the dominant regional publisher and developer of one of the world’s most popular games.

## The future

Sea has one of the highest ceilings in the corporate world. It runs three growing business lines across regional markets with scaling spending power. Extraordinary events or extreme patience are required for Sea to join the trillionaire’s club of Amazon and Apple. Still, it does not seem impossible to believe it could improve 10-20x from here, eclipsing its last high. Adherents may reasonably argue that Sea has venture capital upside, despite already doing $10 billion in revenue a year.

For that to feel like more than idle fantasy, Sea has much work to do. Six items should be at the top of its checklist: 

1.  Fight for Brazil
2.  Lean on logistics
3.  Keep Tencent content
4.  Protect Chris Feng
5.  Increase LTV with SeaMoney
6.  Find the next _Free Fire_

In times of crisis, it is tempting to overreact. As its stock has tumbled, Sea has fled many promising markets, especially in Latin America. Amidst these departures, it’s tempting to think Sea should shutter the experiment for good, focusing the entirety of its resources on Southeast Asia. One source, who believes in Shopee’s Brazilian business, admitted that the market wants consolidation. “If Sea closed down Brazil, the stock would go up 20%,” they conceded.

Succumbing to market pressure would be a mistake. **Brazil** represents [30%](https://www.statista.com/topics/4697/e-commerce-in-brazil/) of Latin America’s e-commerce market, with revenue of $49 billion. By 2025, that figure is expected to increase to $86.5 billion, a 15.8% CAGR. The country also has a highly dynamic fintech market; while [34 million](https://labsnews.com/en/articles/experts/perfect-storm-financial-inclusion-brazil) Brazilians remain unbanked, the population is adopting digital payments at a [historic](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/brazilians-are-adopting-digital-payments-faster-than-anyone-else-what-lessons-can-we-learn/) pace. Critically, staying in the country allows Sea to maintain a regional presence, shipping across borders to Colombia and Argentina, for example. If and when fortunes change, that optionality could be valuable, giving Sea a chance to push its areas of operation outward. 

Sea will not want to miss out on the opportunity to capture the torrid growth of the Brazilian market nor lose optionality. Succeeding will not be easy, though. Both Mercado Libre and [Nubank](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/nubank-finding-brilliance-in-brokenness) are formidable, innovative competitors. While Shopee’s focus on low-cost items has likely grown e-commerce spending, it inevitably rubs shoulders with these businesses.

Those that oppose Sea’s involvement in Brazil will point to the poor unit economics. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the company lost $1.42 per order in the country, more than 4x it's average. However, there’s reason to believe that Sea understands how to manage the transition from unprofitable demand aggregation to break-even. As mentioned earlier, Shopee loses less than $0.01 in Southeast Asia on this adjusted basis. In Brazil, losses are trending in the right direction, with current figures a 33% improvement YoY. Sea will believe it can shepherd this unit to eventual profitability.   
‍  
**Leaning into logistics** is critical to this transformation. Sea was slow to invest in building these capabilities compared to competitors. Though its Shopee Xpress service launched in 2018, it only came to the fore in 2020. Sea’s timing makes sense – while trying to aggregate as much share as possible, it may have concluded money was better spent on discounts and advertising than logistics infrastructure. As it looks at its bottom line more carefully, the importance of reliable, low-cost delivery is becoming increasingly apparent.

According to one source, Sea has shown an ability to build competent in-house logistics. In Indonesia, a [notoriously difficult](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/amazon-indonesia) place to deliver goods, Sea has rolled out Xpress services and slowly transitioned from third-party providers. Not only does this improve per order economics, but it’s also essential to providing a good consumer experience, driving delivery times down from weeks to days. Sea will believe it can continue improving these capabilities in Southeast Asia and undertake a similar mission in Brazil. Mercado Libre boasts impressive logistical strength; Sea must close the gap to provide similar service levels. 

Naturally, 3PLs will be critical, too. Sea has a close relationship with logistics company J&T, an Indonesian player that has recently developed a presence in Brazil. J&T has ramped up to roughly 1,500 employees in two years, suggesting it sees the market as crucial. As long as Shopee continues ramping up order volumes, it will have the leverage to compress partner pricing. 

Logistical brawn also provides some protection against insurgents. Just as Sea took its time to invest in this capability, newcomers are likely to do the same, putting their services at a disadvantage. In particular, Forrest Li will want to keep an eye on TikTok Shop. The Chinese company’s e-commerce effort met headwinds in the U.K., stalling an intended U.S. expansion, but it is thriving in Asia. Sister app Douyin has sold more than [10 billion](https://www.ft.com/content/07b75caf-b2ab-4ace-9bb8-68d42f1da823) products in the Chinese market, reaching a GMV of [$78 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/tiktok-becomes-cash-machine-with-revenue-tripling-to-12-billion?sref=WesoLUpf). Meanwhile, TikTok Shop is attracting strong interest in Vietnam and is live across Southeast Asia. 

While every e-commerce player will look at TikTok Shop with a wary eye, it feels particularly threatening to Sea. It is the ultimate attention-trap with a lucrative existing line of business that is best served to sell low-cost items in beauty and fashion. Business fantasists might enjoy thinking about what the two companies might look like combined: a chimera of games, social media, money, and commerce. (Unlike gaming and e-commerce, there are obvious synergies between gaming and social media.) 

While Shopee is an area of opportunity, Sea will want to ensure it safeguards Garena, too. The division currently has strong downside protection thanks to its relationship with Tencent. Even if Free Fire continues to decline, Garena at least has regional publishing rights for the Chinese conglomerate’s collection of franchises, including _Arena of Valor_, _League of Legends,_ and _Speed Drifters._ Right?

It’s not quite so simple. The agreement Tencent and Sea [signed](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sea-and-tencent-enter-into-long-term-publishing-partnership-300752665.html) in 2018 lasts five years, expiring in 2023. Given the partnership's success, it’s likely to be extended – but it’s not a sure thing. One source spoke of “tension” between the two companies, catalyzed by Garena’s creation of _Free Fire_, with Tencent reasonably wondering whether a developer of games will also be a fair broker when it comes to publishing. Earlier this year, Tencent sold a [$3 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/tencent-to-sell-a-stake-in-singapore-s-sea-for-up-to-3-billion?sref=WesoLUpf) stake in Sea, perhaps indicating a chill had set into the relationship. 

Sea must make sure it protects this relationship. While it cannot stop developing its own games, it should try and placate Tencent, bring them back onside, and lock in another extended exclusivity agreement. This is a defensive rather than offensive maneuver. Firstly, failing to win publishing rights opens the door for another player to step in. Perhaps more importantly, it would break Sea’s narrative. While most of Garena’s earnings come from _Free Fire_, the sense that it has reliable, diversified publishing revenue offers a semblance of stability. Its role as the de-facto distribution partner for the region is also vital to its positioning. If Sea were to lose this grip at the same time as _Free Fire_ showed weakness, it would start to look like a less attractive business: a one-hit wonder with a waning publishing business and unprofitable e-commerce arm.

From a cultural perspective, Sea operates more similarly to Chinese tech companies than Western ones. The company has a strong, top-down culture with leadership heavily involved in day-to-day decision-making. Looking at Sea’s results, that approach seems to have worked. Several sources pointed to the firm’s intensive work ethic and execution ability as important strengths. 

While Sea will not want to lose this ferocity, it may need to be better balanced in some cases. Specifically, it must **protect Chris Feng**, the organization’s president. The fact that Feng has been given this mantle despite not being a founder is a testament to his importance. Before taking on his latest title, Feng served as CEO of Shopee _and_ leader of SeaMoney. He will retain responsibility over both departments as president. 

Feng’s handling of Shopee has been particularly eye-catching. He oversaw its rapid global growth, driving it forward with formidable intensity and effort. “Shopee is all Chris,” one source said.

There are indications that Feng’s infamous stamina may be running thin. One source said Feng is hospitalized annually from overwork, collapsing in the middle of Sea’s offices from exhaustion. Because of Feng’s importance and fatigue, one individual felt the company had a degree of “key man risk.” Sea will need to make sure it does not burn Feng out. It may also need to decentralize power across the organization to reduce such risks going forward. 

Beyond improving Shopee’s economics, one of Feng’s key remits should be to **grow customer LTV via SeaMoney**. The division is growing speedily, extending revenue by 214% YoY; last quarter, it pulled in $279 million.

SeaMoney should look to accelerate this trajectory by building out new, lucrative product lines. The low penetration of traditional banking services in Sea’s markets gives the division a huge opportunity to become the region’s de-facto institution – Southeast Asia’s version of Ant Financial. 

Sea seems awake to the opportunity. The company [purchased](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/singapore-s-sea-said-to-acquire-indonesia-s-bank-bke?srnd=technology-vp&sref=WesoLUpf) Indonesia’s Bank BKE in 2021, improving its ability to offer financial services in the country. A few months earlier, it had [received](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/grab-sea-and-ant-chosen-to-receive-digital-banking-licenses-in-singapore/) a digital banking license from The Monetary Authority of Singapore. Perhaps the only downside of the arrangement is that it requires Sea to maintain approximately [$1.1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/singapore-banks/ant-grabs-venture-and-sea-to-usher-in-singapore-digital-banking-idINKBN28E1E1) in capital on its balance sheet, limiting investments. 

It is worth that inconvenience. In the coming years, Sea should follow the strategy of other financial super-apps, using a high-frequency relationship to layer on lucrative business lines, including savings, investing, and insurance. Indeed, it is [considering](https://www.ft.com/content/d1150ebb-9340-422c-8f7b-a52965014fb5) the purchase of an Indonesian insurance company to undertake such a strategy. 

If I were Forrest Li or Chris Feng, the checklist’s final item would annoy me most: **find the next _Free Fire_**. One may as well say, “create another money-printing machine.” Minting a winning game is at least as much art as science, and success can never be guaranteed. What should be expected of Sea is that it will act _almost_ unreasonably in trying to bring such fruits to bear. The prize is too large, too transformative to do anything less.

First, Sea must continue to seed internal development. The company reportedly rolls out approximately three to four games per year. Many may not be publicly announced, launched via subsidiary studios – those that thrive are eventually claimed. It seems reasonable to suggest that this number could be significantly increased, giving Sea more shots at a breakout title. 

Second, Sea should step up minority and majority investing in gaming companies. In 2020, Garena purchased Phoenix Labs, the Canadian studio behind _Dauntless_, for a reported [$150 million](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/wealth-investing/sea-invests-in-singapore-motion-capture-gaming-startup-refracts-s85m-round). The conglomerate has invested in startups like Forte Games, Double Loop, PopScreen Games, Refract, and UnusuAll. Sea can afford to be much more aggressive here. It should aim to place small checks into as many promising gaming startups as possible, giving it visibility into traction and industry trends. Those with fast-growing franchises or exceptional teams can be folded into Garena, increasing the talent base and diversity of titles. If Tencent is the best acquirer of large game studios, Sea should try to establish itself as the natural destination for less mature businesses. 

Finally, Sea should try to discover how to rationalize the gaming business. Though a fuzzy art, companies like Scopely seem to have found a predictable pattern. The publisher helps small indie developers achieve mainstream success, with [four of its titles in a row](https://venturebeat.com/games/how-scopely-is-building-a-hit-factory-one-mobile-game-at-a-time-interview/) reaching the number one spot for free-to-play games. None of the games Scopely has published are especially complex (though several riff on established IP).

If Sea can figure this out, “all bets are off,” as one source said. The business changes if it can get Garena’s money mill spinning at an even faster RPM. Suddenly, Sea can invest more aggressively in Shopee and SeaMoney, winning further share. It could also bulk up via valuable acquisitions. 

Finding the next _Free Fire_ shouldn’t stop Sea from investing in the current one. Garena has historically done an excellent job keeping the title fresh by dropping fresh skins, celebrity promotions, and special events. That has included turning Cristiano Ronaldo into a playable character and Ramadan-themed offerings.

Free Fire

It has also introduced new modes of gameplay, including “Lone Wolf” (one v. one) and “Clash Squad” (four v. four). The latter has taken off, becoming a popular way of consuming the game. Garena must continue iterating to keep players engaged and tempt back those that might have departed. Over a long enough time horizon, this can help establish _Free Fire_ as a genuine classic and, hopefully, a franchise that can bear successive releases. Just as _League of Legends_ can bank more than $500 million thirteen years after its debut by dropping a new version, _Free Fire_ may one day be able to do the same. 

![](https://assets.website-files.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6000d83070ff9e96671cf34d_Ellipse.png)

Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna started in pole position. In this case, it was a disadvantage. The right side of the Suzuki Circuit, where Senna sat in his McClaren, was rougher, meaning that Alain Prost, in second place, had the cleaner path. Senna had requested to move the pole position to the left-hand side of the track, to no avail. 

Within a second of the light turning green, Prost is away. His Ferrari eats up the smooth part of the track and leaps into the lead. Senna is not about to give up his position so easily, though. He knows that Suzuki is a challenging track with few places to pass. Cede pole once, and you might not see it again. 

Senna takes a hard inside line at the first corner, trying to squeeze himself between Prost’s Ferrari and the track’s edge, but Prost doesn’t budge, and in an instant, the two cars have hit, and they skid across the tarmac and into the dirt. A cloud of dust hangs over them as the men climb out of their battered cars. Their race has ended. 

After the race, Senna [sat down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWXdPSoUT0) for an interview with retired legend Jackie Stewart. The Scotsman asked Senna what he thought of the fact that in the past few years of racing, he had crashed more than every other world champion combined. Senna replied: 

> I find [sic] amazing for you to make such a question Stewart, because you are very experienced, and you know a lot about racing. And you should know that by being a racing driver, you are under risks all the time. By being a racing driver means you are racing with other people. **And if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you're no longer a racing driver.**

Senna’s words are apt when thinking about Sea Limited. The Singaporean conglomerate thrives on seeing the gap and bursting through. It is a skilled driver, knowing when to seize the moment and capture opportunities in game development, e-commerce, and fintech. In its striving, Sea can find itself close to the edge, and sometimes, it may spin out in a cloud of dust and smoke. There will be more quarters like Sea’s last where the machine collides with reality, with the market, with itself. But if it no longer goes for the gap that exists, it would no longer be Sea.
