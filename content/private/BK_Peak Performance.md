# Peak Performance
[Peak Performance](notes/B_Peak%20Performance.md)
## FOREWORD: Is Healthy, Sustainable Peak Performance Possible?
These stories aren’t unique. They happen everywhere and can happen to anyone. Including us. We, the authors of this book, are the runner (Steve) and the consultant (Brad). We met a couple years after we had both burnt out, and as we shared our stories over a few beers, we realized they were quite similar. At the time, we were both beginning our second lives: Steve as a performance scientist and budding coach of endurance athletes, and Brad as an emerging writer. Both of us were embarking on new journeys, and we couldn’t help but wonder: Could we reach the highest levels of performance without repeating our previous failings?

We can’t guarantee that reading this book will set you on a path to winning Olympic gold, painting the next masterpiece, or breaking ground in mathematical theory. Genetics play an unfortunately undeniable role in all of those things. What we can guarantee, however, is that reading this book will help you nurture your nature so that you can maximize your potential in a healthy and sustainable way.


## INTRODUCTION Great Expectations


If we’ve done our job well, by the time you finish reading this book, you’ll thoroughly understand: 
•  The scientific cycle behind growth and development
•  How to prime for peak performance and daily productivity 
•  The power of purpose as a performance enhancer


## SECTION 1: THE GROWTH EQUATION
### 1 THE SECRET TO SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS

How you treat yourself in between workouts is where you make gains and acquire the strength to attack the next one.”

  416-417    

Kastor says she realized early on that simply working hard wouldn’t do. She’s even called her workouts the easy part. What sets her apart, the magic that has allowed her to run so fast and so far for the past 25 years, is how she recovers:

  417-419    

they were systematically alternating between bouts of very intense work and periods of easy training and recovery, even if that meant walking up hills. The ongoing progression and development of elite competitors, Seiler found, was an exercise in stress and rest.

  437-438    

Csikszentmihalyi documented a common process across almost all great intellectual and creative performers, regardless of their field: 1.  Immersion: total engagement in their work with deep, unremitting focus   2.Incubation: a period of rest and recovery when they are not at all thinking about their work 3.  Insight: the occurrence of “aha” or “eureka” moments—the emergence of new ideas and growth in their thinking

  450-454    

PERFORMANCE PRACTICES •  Alternate between cycles of stress and rest in your most important pursuits. •  Insert short breaks throughout your work over the course of a day. •  Strategically time your “off-days,” long weekends, and vacations to follow periods of heavy stress. •  Determine when your work regularly starts to suffer. When you find that point, insert a recovery break just prior to it.

  457-464    

Research shows that even if their bodies are fresh, the physical performance of people who are mentally fatigued suffers. Put differently, the boundaries between mental and physical fatigue are not nearly as defined as we think.

  491-493    

### 2 RETHINKING STRESS
We now know our adaptive stress response is rooted in molecules called inflammatory proteins and a hormone called cortisol. Inflammatory proteins and cortisol are activated by stress and serve as biological messengers, telling the body, “We’re not strong enough to withstand this attack!” As a result, the body marshals an army of biochemical building blocks and directs them to the area under stress, making the body stronger and more resilient. This is the body’s incredible, preprogrammed way of better preparing itself to face future threats.

  581-585    

Rather than simply answering a specific question, it is beneficial to be challenged and even to fail. Failure provides an opportunity to analyze a problem from different angles, pushing us to understand its deep underlying structure and to hone the transferrable skill of problem-solving itself.

  640-642    

the best learning occurs when we really have to work for it. Just like struggling to eke out one last repetition in the weight room is a great method for growing the body, struggling to the point of failure and only then receiving assistance is a great recipe for growing the mind. If you want to continuously improve in whatever it is that you do, you’ve got to view stress as something positive, even desirable.

  662-665    

PERFORMANCE PRACTICES •  Stress stimulates growth. •  As the chess prodigy turned martial arts champion Josh Waitzkin says, “growth comes at the point of resistance.” •  Developing a new capability requires effort: Skills come from struggle. •  When you struggle, System 2 is activated and true development is underway; myelin is accumulating and neural connections are strengthening. •  Fail productively: Only seek out support after you’ve allowed yourself to struggle.

  666-674    

### 3 STRESS YOURSELF

In every field that’s been studied (from wine tasting to financial investing), when it came to differentiating top performers, experience was not the critical variable. In some cases, it was nearly impossible for Ericsson to distinguish between the performances of novices and long-time veterans. Regardless of what angle he examined it from, Ericsson found experience and expertise did not necessarily go hand in hand.

  736-739    

How was everyone practicing? The answer was: quite differently. The best violinists spent significantly more time intensely focused on mastering a specific goal, and remained totally present when doing so. They eliminated all distractions. They rarely, if ever, merely went through the motions. The best violinists were practicing, as Ericsson and his team coined it, far more “deliberately” than everyone else.

  748-751    

It isn’t experience that sets top performers apart but the amount of deliberate practice they put in. Although Ericsson would become associated with the Malcolm Gladwell–popularized 10,000-hour rule—the notion that anyone can become an expert at anything by practicing for 10,000 hours—his actual findings represent something quite different. Expertise is not about a certain number of hours practiced. Rather, it’s about the type of work that fills those hours. Practice doesn’t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.

  752-756    

What really differentiates deliberate practice is deep concentration.

  758-759    

He prioritizes his physical health, exercising for at least an hour nearly every day. Most important, he is a wonderful husband and father of two young girls, almost always home in time for dinner, and present at extracurricular activities. So when we met with Dr. Bob at his Palo Alto office, what we wanted to learn most is how—how does he accomplish so much while seemingly maintaining balance in his life? He answered our question without needing to say a word. From the minute we walked into the room with Dr. Bob, we were in the room with Dr. Bob. We were not in the room with Dr. Bob’s email, phone, or any interrupting colleagues. Prior to our time together he was crafting an article for a high-profile medical journal and making decisions about the future of a company. But he didn’t bring those issues into the room with us either. It was just the three of us discussing this book. The energy was palpable. He gave us the same attention he gives to the president of the United States. Dr. Bob was fully present. We were witnessing in real time his secret to success.

  792-794    

His insistence on **single-tasking** ensures that he learns and grows from every document he drafts and every interaction he’s involved in. “It’s not that I can’t multitask,” he says. “But when I do multitask everything suffers. So I just don’t multitask. Ever.”

  792-794    

He compartmentalizes his day down to the hour. **Each compartment has a concrete objective**. These objectives range from, for example: write 500 words for a paper; learn enough about a company to make an investment decision; have a free-flowing conversation with an interesting person; keep his heart rate at 80 percent of its maximum in a fitness class; influence a decision maker in a highly political meeting; enjoy dinner with his wife and kids. This type of compartmentalization ensures he follows **his governing rule: “Do only one thing at a time.” Dr. Bob’s secret to doing so much is doing so little**.

  794-798    

Apply the components of perfect practice each time you set out to do meaningful work: •  Define a purpose and concrete objectives for each working session. •  Ask yourself: What do I want to learn or get done? •  Focus and concentrate deeply, even if doing so isn’t always enjoyable. •  Single-task: The next time you feel like multitasking, remind yourself that research shows it’s not effective. Keep in mind Dr. Bob’s secret: “Do only one thing at a time.” •  Remember that quality trumps quantity.

  822-830    

Unlike other neurochemicals that are released when we’ve achieved something, the far more potent dopamine is released prior to the payoff of an event, when we are longing for or desiring something deeply. In other words, we don’t become addicted to winning; we become addicted to the chase.

  849-851    

•  Identify what interrupts your deep focus. Common intruders, many of which are enabled by smartphones, include:   Text messages   Social media   The internet   Television •  Remove distractors: Remember that only out of sight truly leads to out of mind.

  901-909    

Ericsson found that top performers across all fields are unable to sustain intense work and deep concentration for more than 2 hours. Outside of rare, short-term situations, once this threshold is passed, neither the body nor the mind can sustain the workload. Great performers, Ericsson found, generally work in chunks of 60 to 90 minutes separated by short breaks.

  912-915    

The Draugiem Group found that their all-star workers adhered to a particular routine: They spent 52 minutes engrossed in their work before taking a 17-minute break.

  919-920    

Without fail, regardless of industry or job description, chunks of hard work followed by short breaks yielded the best performance.

  921-922    

While the exact work-to-rest ratio depends on the demands of the job and individual preferences, the overall theme is clear: alternating between blocks of 50 to 90 minutes of intense work and recovery breaks of 7 to 20 minutes enables people to sustain the physical, cognitive, and emotional energy required for peak performance. **This ebb and flow runs counter to the all-too-common constant grind of either perpetually working in an “inbetween zone” of moderately hard work or working at the utmost intensity nonstop**. Neither of these more traditional approaches is ideal. The former leads to under-performance. The latter leads to physical, cognitive, and emotional fatigue and, eventually, burnout.

  925-929    

In the 1930s, when German running coach Woldemar Gerschler first developed interval training, or intense repetitions of running with short breaks in between, the objective was simple: enable a runner to accomplish the greatest possible amount of high-quality work before fatigue caused performance to suffer. Nearly a century later, Steve and just about every other top running coach still rely upon intervals to increase the amount of quality work their athletes can execute. And, although it’s taken nearly 100 years, it’s nice to see that progressive employers are finally beginning to realize the value of intervals off the track.

  934-938    

•  Divide your work into chunks of 50 to 90 minutes (this may vary by task). Start even smaller if you find yourself struggling to maintain attention. •  As you develop “fitness” in whatever it is you are doing, you’ll likely find that you can work longer and harder. •  For most activities and most situations, 2 hours should be the uppermost limit for a working block.

  944-949    
==2022.01.03 stopped here== 
It’s easy to dismiss the impact of “mindsets” as a pop-psychology concept aimed at making us feel better about ourselves, but the hard science tells a different story. The lens through which we view the world affects everything from learning to health to longevity to our hormonal response to “different” milkshakes.

  963-965    

the way we think about the world has a profound effect on what we do in it. If we cultivate a growth mindset and believe that skills come from struggle, then we are more likely to expose ourselves to the good kind of growth-promoting stress. But the power of mindsets doesn’t stop there. It turns out that our mindset toward stress not only determines if we’ll expose ourselves to it, but also how we’ll respond.

  1016-1018    

When under stress, you want to release more DHEA than cortisol. This ratio is aptly named the “growth index of stress.” Sure enough, studies show that people who react to stress with a challenge response have a higher growth index of stress versus those who perceive stress as a threat. In other words, if you frame stressors as challenges, you’ll release more DHEA than cortisol. As a result your growth index of stress will be higher, and you’ll actually experience health benefits instead of health detriments. And, according to the 2010 study on stress and mortality that we mentioned earlier, you might just live longer, too. It’s

  1016-1020    

Are the elites simply immune to stress? Of course not. They just know how to channel it effectively.

  1026-1026    

Fortunately, according to the authors of this paper, simply telling yourself “I am excited” shifts your demeanor from what they call a threat mindset (stressed out and apprehensive) to an opportunity mindset (revved up and ready to go).

  1038-1040    

Put differently: The sensations you feel prior to a big event are neutral—if you view them in a positive light, they are more likely to have a positive impact on your performance. These studies confirm what every great performer we interviewed for this book told us. They all admitted to feeling stress, especially prior to big performances. But they also all said that rather than try to push the stress away, they welcome and channel it toward the task at hand.

  1041-1044    

•  Remember the power of mindset: How you view something fundamentally changes how your body responds to it. •  In situations when you feel the sensation of stress, remind yourself this is your body’s natural way of preparing for a challenge; take a deep breath and channel the heightened arousal and sharper perception toward the task at hand. •  Challenge yourself to view stress productively, and even to welcome it. You’ll not only perform better, you’ll also improve your health.

  1059-1065    

### 4 THE PARADOX OF REST

The calm conversation goes something like this: “This is starting to hurt now. It should. I’m running hard. But I am separate from this pain. It is going to be okay.” Just like the expert meditators, Steve’s best runners choose how they respond to the stress of a workout. Their amygdalas are not hijacked.

  1169-1171    

Developing your mindful muscle creates space for you to choose how you want to respond to stress. In the middle of a challenge, mindfulness helps you remain calm and collected. It lets you devote all your physical and psychological energy to completing the task at hand, not to worrying about it. After a challenge, mindfulness lets you choose to turn off stress and transition to a more restful state. As we’ve seen, this might mean slowing your racing mind, or slowing your racing heartbeat. Whether you are an engineer or an athlete, mindfulness serves as a gateway to rest, helping you get there faster and more predictably.

  1193-1197    

•  Frequency trumps duration. It’s best to meditate daily, even if that means keeping individual sessions short.

  1214-1215    

If not in the shower, maybe your best ideas come to you when you are on a run or a walk. Many esteemed philosophers, from Kierkegaard to Thoreau, held their daily walk as something sacred, the key to generating new ideas. “Methinks that the moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow,” Thoreau famously penned in his journal.

  1250-1252

Our most profound ideas often come from the small spaces in between otherwise deliberate thinking: when our brains are at rest. Science bears this out. Researchers have found that despite spending the vast majority of our waking hours in effortful thought, over 40 percent of our creative ideas manifest during breaks.

  1258-1261    

•  During your breaks, if you aren’t sleeping (more on this soon), perform activities that demand little to no effortful thinking. Though we’ll explore in great detail how to fill your breaks in Chapter 5, some examples include:   Listening to music   Going on a short walk   Sitting in nature   Taking a shower   Doing the dishes •  You may have an “aha” moment of insight during your break. If you do, great. Even if you don’t have an “aha” moment during your break, your subconscious mind is still at work. When you return to whatever it is you were doing, you’ll be more likely to make progress.

  1305-1318    

In a society that glorifies grinding, short-term gains and pushing to extremes, it takes guts to rest. Just as Dixon does with the triathletes he coaches, perhaps we should all reframe rest. Rest isn’t lazily slothing around; it’s an active process in which physical and psychological growth occurs. To reap the benefits of stress, you need to rest.

### 5 REST LIKE THE BEST

  1379-1380    

Stepping away from your work takes a lot of guts, especially when you’re on a tight deadline. Sometimes you simply don’t have the time to walk very far. The good news is that even short walks can provide big benefits.

  1396-1397    

However, it appears that the benefits might also stem from the interplay between walking and attention. Since walking requires just enough coordination to occupy the part of our brain responsible for effortful thinking, it ever so slightly distracts our conscious mind. As a result, when walking, it’s easier to tap into our creative engine, our subconscious. This explains why walking tends to be more effective at fostering creativity than other movements that require greater focus and coordination, like dancing or lifting weights. Walking occupies us just enough to help us stop thinking about whatever it is we were working on, but not too much as to prevent mind-wandering. It’s the perfect gateway into the subconscious mind and for stimulating creative insight that can help us overcome mental gridlock.

  1406-1412    

Even if all you can manage is switching windows on your computer, try browsing a National Geographic or Outside magazine story with pictures of nature rather than your Facebook or Twitter feed. Exposure to nature not only helps with creativity, but it may also lower levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule associated with inflammation in the body. Lower levels of IL-6 can prevent the harmful, chronic type of inflammation that often sidelines serious athletes. According to a study published in the journal Emotion, more than any other positive feeling, awe, an emotion commonly brought about by nature, is linked to lower levels of IL-6. We asked the lead author of the study, Jennifer Stellar, PhD, what might be going on here. How can something as simple as being in nature, or even just looking at pictures of nature, change our biology? Stellar told us that “experiencing awe makes us feel more connected to the universe and more humble.” These feelings, she says, “probably help to ‘switch off’ our stress response, in turn lessening inflammation.”

  1429-1437    

After your next hard workout or stressful day at the office, consider sitting in a park before you rush into an ice bath, pop anti-inflammatory drugs, or take the latest and greatest relaxation supplement.

  1437-1438    

If you remain stressed after taking a break (by stepping away from the keyboard or the barbell), you will lose much of the break’s effectiveness. It’s not hard to tell if your break is being hijacked by lingering stress. You generally feel it in your shoulders (are they raised?), forearms (are they flexed?), and jaw (is it clenched?). If you experience these sensations, you might want to consider a short bout of mindfulness meditation.

  1446-1449    

Sit down in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take 10 deep breaths, in and out through your nose. Focus on only the sensation of your breath. Physical pain, tightness, and negative thoughts may arise. If they do, do not ignore them. Rather, acknowledge them non-judgmentally, let them go, and then return to focusing on your breath. After you’ve taken 10 breaths, you could continue focusing exclusively on your breath for the duration of your break. Or, you could consider transitioning to a technique called “open-monitoring” meditation, sometimes referred to as a “body scan.”

  1449-1453    

“The basic biology of feeling connected to others has profound effects on stress physiology,” McGonigal told us. The positive effects of social connection include increasing heart rate variability (HRV), shifting the nervous system into recovery mode, and releasing hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. “What’s even crazier,” says McGonigal, “is that oxytocin helps your heart repair. It’s pretty poetic that feeling connected to others literally fixes a broken heart.”

  1469-1472    

•  Have the courage to takes breaks throughout the day, especially when you are stuck or feeling unbearable stress; the more intense the work, the more frequent the breaks. •  Take a walk lasting at least 6 minutes to increase creativity and decrease the ill effects of sitting. If you can, walk outdoors, but even taking a few laps around the office provides big benefits. •  Put yourself in the way of beauty. Being in nature, or even just looking at pictures of nature, helps with the transition from stress to rest and promotes creative thinking. •  Meditate. Begin with a few mindful breaths, focusing only on the breath. Then, consider shifting to open-monitoring meditation, scanning your body and shifting your awareness to all of its sensations. •  Hang out with friends! At the end of hard work—be it with your body or your mind—surrounding yourself with friends in a laid-back environment fundamentally alters your biology from stress to rest.

  1483-1493    

Sleep is one of the most productive things we can do. We don’t grow when we’re in the gym or when we’re immersed in our work: We grow in our sleep.

  1521-1522    

Almost all of sleep’s benefits occur in the later stages, mainly during something called REM, or rapid eye movement. We spend only about 20 to 25 percent of our total sleep time in REM. And, in an interesting twist, the longer we sleep, the greater the proportion of it is in REM. That’s because REM time increases with each sleep cycle. In other words, there are increasing marginal returns to sleep. Hours 7 to 9—the hours that the majority of us never get—are actually the most powerful.

  1550-1553    

Let’s pause for just a moment to reflect upon this in the context of the equation stress + rest = growth. During our waking hours we expose ourselves to all kinds of psychological stimulus (stress), and during our sleep (rest) we make sense of it all. As a result, we’re literally more evolved when we wake up the next morning. In our sleep, we grow. And we grow not just our cognitive and emotional muscles but our physical ones, too.

  1556-1559    

Regardless of what all the “life hackers” may tell you, napping does not make up for insufficient nighttime sleep. You can’t nap your way to growth, be it physical or psychological. That said, napping does help restore energy and concentration during midday lulls, so it’s a strategy worth considering for long and intense days.

  1609-1611    

When we take short naps, the part of our brain that is always on when we are awake has the opportunity to take a break. Much like a fatigued muscle rejuvenates during a short breather, so, too, does this part of our brain. In a critical review on the efficacy of napping, sleep scientists found that a 10-minute nap yields the greatest benefits, though most experts say anything under 30 minutes is effective. Even if you don’t actually experience the sensation of falling asleep, simply closing your eyes can help switch your active brain off, allowing it to recover. Staying asleep for more than 30 minutes, however, can be counterproductive. This is because with longer naps we run the risk of waking up feeling even groggier and more sluggish than before we fell asleep. This condition, called “sleep inertia,” occurs when we are awoken in the middle of a deep sleep cycle. The grogginess is the body and brain’s natural way of telling us to go back to sleep so it can finish what it started. (Hence the term “inertia.”) Deep sleep generally doesn’t begin until after about 30 minutes, which is why experts suggest making that the upper limit for a nap’s duration.

  1618-1626    

 Exercise. Vigorous physical activity makes us tired. When we are tired, we sleep. But don’t exercise too close to bedtime.

  1640-1641    

 If you struggle with a racing mind, try inserting a brief mindfulness meditation session prior to bed.

  1652-1654    

 When you feel yourself getting drowsy, don’t fight it. Whatever you are doing can wait until the morning.

  1655-1656    

•  Try taking a nap of 10 to 30 minutes to help restore energy and focus if you hit a mid-afternoon lull.

  1660-1661    

We consistently work on weekends and rarely use all our paid time off, let alone take extended vacations. Instead, we get trapped into thinking that if we’re not always working hard, we’ll be surpassed by the competition. Our misguided thinking is the result of years of conditioning.

  1672-1674    

If we never take “easy” periods, we are never able to go full throttle and the “hard” periods end up being not that hard at all. We get stuck in a gray zone, never really stressing ourselves but never really resting either. This vicious cycle is often referred to by a much less vicious name—“going through the motions”—but it’s a huge problem nonetheless. That’s because few people grow when they are going through the motions. In order to give it our all, and do so over a long time horizon without burning out, we’ve got to be more like Bernard Lagat: Every now and then, we’ve got to take it really easy. In addition to his year-end break, Lagat also takes an off-day at the end of every hard training week.

  1677-1682    

There is a high cost of neglecting to rest on the weekends: The quality of the work we do during the week suffers, leaving us feeling pressured to work on Saturday and Sunday just to catch up. We get caught in the vicious cycle: not enough stress to demand rest, not enough rest to support real stress. If you are stuck in this cycle right now, try ending it this coming weekend. Give yourself at least one day off, in which you completely disconnect from your work and other similar stressors. The benefits are significant and scientific. Studies show that vigor and performance increase following a rest day, and the more someone actually rests on the weekend, the more effort they expend during the week.

  1689-1694    

The BCG consultants discovered that it’s not just about accumulating hours but about the quality of the work produced in those hours. By working even 20 percent less, the consultants were able to get a lot more done, and feel better about it, too.

  1761-1763    

## SECTION 2: PRIMING
### 6 OPTIMIZE YOUR ROUTINE

  1792-1792    

Equally as important as conjuring a positive mood is avoiding a negative one. In the interest of upping your performance, try to avoid people, places, and things that may put you in a negative mood. While there are instances when these factors may be out of your control, it is important to realize the impact mood plays on performance. How and with whom you spend your time, especially preceding meaningful work, really matters.

  1882-1884    

The latest science suggests it’s extremely hard to perform well at work if other elements of your life are not in harmony. Be kind to yourself and others who are going through challenging times, and recognize that disconnecting “work” from “life” is an illusion.

  1886-1887    

•  Reflect upon the activities in your life that are most important to you. •  Determine what state of mind and/or body they demand. •  Prime yourself for performance by readying your mind and/or body prior to key activities. •  Test and refine various priming techniques, eventually developing customized routines. •  Be consistent: Use the same routine each and every time you engage in the activity to which it is linked (more on the importance of consistency in a bit). •  Remember the impact of mood on performance; positivity goes a long way.

  1906-1914    

•  Create “a place of your own” in which you do your most important work. •  Surround yourself with objects that invite your desired behaviors. •  Consistently work in that same place, using the same materials. •  Over time, your environment will enhance your productivity on a deep neurological level.

  1951-1956    

•  If your pursuit requires variable settings, develop portable cues/routines that can be executed anywhere (e.g., a deep-breathing routine, self-talk, etc.). •  Consistency is king. The best routine means nothing if you don’t regularly practice it.

  1990-1994    

### 7 MINIMALIST TO BE A MAXIMALIST



“I block off between 60 and 90 minutes every day to read outside of my domain,” he told us. “This helps me generate new ideas.” But Joyner only does this extensive reading because he identified creativity as something integral to his research, and reading broadly is one of his conduits to creativity. He doesn’t expend time or energy on anything that is not critical to his mission. “In order to be a maximalist,” he says, “you have to be a minimalist.” Take note: This does not mean you should aspire to be narrow or overly specialized. As we’ve seen in this book, many great performers have diverse interests that work together to feed their success. What this does mean, however, is that you should identify and strive to cut out all the superficial things in your life. You should be fully intentional with how you spend your most precious resource of all: time.

  2046-2052    

If Joyner’s philosophy and lifestyle sound familiar, that’s because they are similar to that of another great performer we met in Chapter 3: Bob Kocher, MD. Dr. Bob compartmentalizes his day down to the minute, ensuring that each compartment has a distinct purpose. Like Joyner, Dr. Bob is very intentional about what he does and doesn’t do, where he does and doesn’t devote his energy.

  2069-2072    

A recent study found that physicians make significantly more prescribing errors as the day wears on. Jeffrey Linder, MD, lead author on the study, told the New York Times, “The radical notion here is that doctors are people too, and we may be fatigued and make worse decisions toward the end of our clinic sessions.”

  2104-2106    

The key to being a minimalist is making a routine out of just about everything that is not core to your mission. When decisions are automatic, you skip the conscious deliberation and associated brain activity.

  2121-2123    

•  In addition to eliminating as many decisions as possible, don’t devote brainpower to gossip, politics, or worrying about what others think of you.

  2142-2144    

While we perform best on work that demands deep focus and attention during our peak hours (i.e., mornings for larks and evenings for owls), the opposite holds true for generating creative ideas. As we learned in Chapter 4, creativity often requires stepping away from whatever it is we are working on and letting our minds wander. In doing so, we unleash the creative power of our subconscious (our brain’s default-mode network). During our peak hours, when we are hyper-alert and focused, our conscious mind is dominant. But during our off-peak hours, as we become fatigued and struggle to maintain focus, our more creative mind has a better opportunity to shine. It should come as no surprise, then, that researchers have found larks perform best on tasks requiring creative insight in the evening, whereas owls tend to be most creative in the morning.

 Don’t fight fatigue! Rather, use this time for recovery and to generate creative ideas that you can act on during your next cycle of high energy and focus.

•  Recognize the enormous power of the people with whom you surround yourself. •  Positive energy, motivation, and drive are all contagious. Do what you can to cultivate your own village of support, to surround yourself with a culture of performance. •  Remember that by being positive and showing motivation, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also helping everyone else in your life. •  Unfortunately, negativity and pessimism are also contagious. Don’t put up with too much of either. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

He told us that when he is most fed up—on the verge of wanting to quit altogether—it’s not the potential financial rewards or the acclaim he’ll receive for his next great work that he thinks about. “When I’m really down and drowning in it, I remind myself of why I do this in the first place,” he said. “I create art to make people smile, cry, connect to one another, and connect to the earth. To be a part of something bigger. That makes putting up with all the crap worth it.”

Duckworth found that grit is not innate. Rather, it can be cultivated over time. While there is no single way to develop grit, the trait is often accompanied by a strong sense of purpose. Especially when the going gets tough, gritty people draw upon a greater cause for inspiration and stick-to-itiveness. As Duckworth and her colleagues wrote in a 2014 paper, “Highly aversive experiences may become more bearable when they are viewed as having positive consequences that transcend the self.” The power of purpose strikes yet again, this time as a theme underlying grit.

•  We are constantly balancing perception of effort, or how hard something feels, with motivation. •  If we want to endure more effort, which often leads to better performance, we may need to increase our motivation. •  The best way to increase motivation is to link our work to a greater purpose or cause. •  Not only will focusing on activities that help others make the world a better place, it will also make you a better performer. •  Especially when we are feeling tired or worn out, we should think about why we are doing what we are doing.

That different manner is “giving back” to your field. This can take many forms, including volunteering and mentoring, but the basic gist is that you should focus on helping others. Helping others activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. Not only does this make you feel better, but it also helps you re-associate positive emotions with your pursuit. For these reasons, giving back often results in renewed energy and motivation. In his New York Times bestselling book Give and Take, Grant references research from across fields—from teaching to nursing—to show that giving back is a powerful antidote to burnout.

•  Find opportunities to give back in the context of your work; these can be more intensive, such as coaching and mentoring, or less intensive, such as posting sincere advice in online forums. •  The only criteria is that your “giving” is closely linked to your work and that you give without the expectation of getting anything back. •  While “giving” is especially powerful for preventing and reversing burnout, you should still aim to avoid burnout by supporting stress with appropriate rest.

### 9 DEVELOP YOUR PURPOSE


But self-talk is a strategy that can be lifted out of athletics and put to great use in other fields, too. Regardless of what you are doing—whether you are using your body, mind, or soul—repeating a purpose-driven mantra during times of fear, pain, or apprehension can yield big benefits. Doing so grounds us, attenuates negative emotions, and quiets our ego, which as you learned in Chapter 8 loves nothing more than telling us to quit.

Coming full circle, we also think it’s a good idea to reflect on your purpose every night. In particular, we encourage you to ask yourself: On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being “completely” and 1 being “not at all”), did you live today with purpose? After making your ranking, spend just a minute or two reflecting on what you could have done differently to move closer to a 10. If you gave yourself a 10, reflect on what you did to get there. This short and simple act goes a long way toward helping you make the changes necessary to live in fuller alignment with your purpose, which as you already know improves performance in just about everything. While it’s fine to go through this exercise in your head, research suggests that physically writing these reflections down enhances not only your performance but also your health.

## CONCLUSION


•  In situations when you feel the sensation of stress, remind yourself that this is your body’s natural way of preparing for a challenge. Take a deep breath and channel the heightened arousal and sharper perception into the task at hand. •  Push yourself to view stress productively, and even to welcome it. You’ll not only perform better but also improve your health.

  2853-2856    

•  Frequency trumps duration. It’s best to meditate daily, even if that means keeping individual sessions short.

  2866-2867    

•  Have “calm conversations” during stressful periods; remember that you are separate from the emotions and sensations that you are experiencing.

  2868-2870    

•  Regardless of the work you do, take at least one off-day every week.
