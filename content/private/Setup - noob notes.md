Terminal: Git commit stuff 
- use 'ls' to see what the directories are
- Usually it's just cd quartz
- Doing it once is enough 
- Then type the rest 

```shell
# Navigate to Quartz folder
cd <path-to-quartz>

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "message describing changes"

# Push to GitHub to update site
git push origin hugo
```

This will then push changes to the github directory...

- playing around with the terminal, how to move here and there. e.g. to change username 
- Set up the files, the website is up, linking to a new obsidian vault and putting in some test files 
- Getting the 'sync' to work... Like a software developer 
- Figuring out where the files are after 'cloning' it using git lol. Never knew it worked like this 
- Just google whatever problem and stack overflow could have a solution. That's how it's like to be a software developer?? LOL
- Learning some new terms / mental models when it comes to software development... And the tools of the trade. Just brushing the surface; wonder if  I would ever be able to be a half decent one. But seems like a big part of it is troubleshooting, which is surely not my thing lol. The satisfaction upon troubleshooting is never going to exceed the frustration? 
- Figuring out how to log in, some personal token thing on Github... https://github.com/settings/tokens This seems to expire in 1 month, so I must remember how to do it lol. I think just create a new one and check all the boxes, that seems to work
