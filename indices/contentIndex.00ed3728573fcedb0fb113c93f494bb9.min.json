Effectiveness is something separate, something different. But to be effective also does not require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness as an executive demands doing certain—and fairly simple—things. It consists of a small number of practices, the practices that are presented and discussed in this book. But these practices are not “inborn.” \n## Introduction: What makes an effective executive? \n- The 8 practices\n\t- They asked, “What needs to be done?”\n\t- They asked, “What is right for the enterprise?”\n\t- They developed action plans.\n\t- They took responsibility for decisions.\n\t- They took responsibility for communicating.\n\t- They were focused on opportunities rather than problems. \n\t- They ran productive meetings.\n\t- They thought and said “we” rather than “I.”\n- **Get the Knowledge you need**\n\t- I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time. Hence, after asking what needs to be done, the effective executive sets priorities and sticks to them\n\t- Other tasks, no matter how important or appealing, are postponed. However, after completing the original top- priority task, the executive **resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list**. He asks, “**What must be done now?**” This generally results in new and different priorities.\n- **Write an action plan**\n\t- **Executives are doers; they execute**. Knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds. But before springing into action, the executive needs to **plan his course**. He needs to think about desired **results**, probable **restraints**, future **revisions**, **check-in points**, and **implications** for how he’ll spend his time.\n\t- “What contributions should the enterprise expect from me over the next 18 months to two years? What results will I commit to? With what deadlines?” \n\t- Restraints on action\n\t- the action plan needs to create a **system for checking the results** against the expectations.\n\t- It should be **revised often**, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure\n\t- The action plan has to become the **basis for time management**. **==Time is the executive's scarcest and most precious resource==**\n- **Act**\n\t- **Take responsibility for decisions**\n\t\t- A **systematic decision review** can be a powerful tool for self- development, too. Checking the results of a decision against its expectations shows executives what their strengths are, where they need to improve, and where they lack knowledge or information. It shows them their biases.\n\t- **Take responsibility for communicating**\n\t- **Focus on opportunities (rather than problems)**\n\t\t- Problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.\n\t- **Make meetings productive**\n\t\t- The key to running an effective meeting is to decide in advance what kind of meeting it will be. Different kinds of meetings require different forms of preparation and different results\n\t\t- **Good follow up** is just as important as the meeting itself\n\t\t- **Think and say \"We\"**\n- **Listen first, speak last**","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_A-Guide-To-The-Good-Life":{"title":"A Guide To The Good Life","content":"[Books](notes/Books.md) | [Stoicism](notes/2_Stoicism.md)\nDate summarised: WIP\n## The book in 3 sentences\n## Impressions\nBasic idea: using our rational thinking to be able to gain tranquility, and reduce negative emotions. \nTechniques to get there: negative visualisation, triaging between what you can/cannot control, fatalism (letting go of the past), self denial, meditation \n\n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n[[BA_Good Life_14 Fame]]\n[[BA_Good Life_15 Luxurious Living]]\n\nA philosophy for seeking tranquility, which is what we should be after.

Whether the significance is positive or negative depends on whether it's fragile or antifragile \n\t- [[C_Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence]]: antifragile: good news tends to be absent from past data. 'Hiding qualities, not the defects'. Fragile: bad news doesn't show easily.\n\t- Fragile Turkey problem: exposed to large downside (e.g. blockfi) with limited outside; negative asymmetry\n\t\t- e.g. banking industry \n\t- Antifragile Inverse turkey problem (positive asymmetry): the 'unseen' is positive, so we tend to underestimate the total benefits by missing the positive events \n\t\t- E.g. biotech industry / anything R\u0026D\n\t- The consequence is *anything in economic life that has antifragile properties is inhibited* as people don't recognise the hidden upside, instead favouring the fragile 'sure bet'\n\t- **[[2_Reinsurance]] companies**: catastrophic events hit RI only negatively, and *tend to be absent from past data*.

While we accept the domain-specificity of games, we find it hard to apply this lesson to technical skills applied in schools: *what is picked up in the classroom stays largely in the classroom*\n- **An Antifragile (Barbell) Education**: very relatable, as it talks about good grades isn't so useful outside school\n\t- Be an 'autodidact', a person of knowledge compared to students who swallow school material, and knowledge only derived from the curriculum. The edge isn't in the package of the official program of school, which *everyone knew with small variations multiplying into large discrepancies in grades*, but *what exactly lay outside it*\n\t- Analogy of gym rats vs street gangsters: you can lift heavy weights but fail to lift a stone, and get hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. The gym rat's strength is extremely *domain-specific and their domain doesn't exist outside of ludic - extremely organised - constructs*. In fact, their strength, as with overspecialised athletes, is the result of a *deformity*.\n\t- This is a lesson also in being [[Farnam Street|positioned for success]], **don't need to be so focused on a certain goal, a certain exam to pass**... Not like the actuarial lecturer (or maybe he's just learning more widely but in a more structured way). \n\t- The author reads voraciously outside a curriculum, away from the gym machine. He keeps a log of his reading hours since age 13 (30-60 / week!) #actionable and that's what I do already \n\t- So why is this better than being a very good student? Perhaps because of the domain specificity of doing well on exams. \n\t- A personal story of the author on how he started to specialise deeply in risk (small probability events, black swans...) and made a career out of it after just going down the rabbit hole and reading very voraciously, not in the structured way of schooling. Maybe the lesson here is that **don't read or try to learn stuff with the explicit intention of getting something out of it**... \n\t- *What one needs to know for a profession is necessarily what lies outside the corpus, as far away from the centre as possible.* How to apply this to actuarial, when in the early years exams plays a central role to your career? At least I'm done with exams for now! Maybe to convince me for now **not to study for more exams...** \n\n## Chapter 17 - Fat Tony Debates Socrates\n2022.07.11\n- **Overall thoughts:** a bit hard to follow everything, but it seems like he is trying to explain that you *don't need to be able to explain everything for it to make sense*. And some other seemingly important points like payoff being the most important thing.

Yin and yang. ...\n- 'Structured learning likes the impoverishment and simplification of naive rationalism, easy to teach, not the rich texture of empiricism'. \n\t- Ernest Renan: logic, by definition, excludes nuances, and since *truth resides exclusively in the nuances*, logic is a 'useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences'\n- 'Things are too complicated to be expressed in words'. Another thing I heard before: you need the vocabulary of something to be useful to converse about it, or something like that. How to marry these 2 ideas together? \n- How the ancients saw *naive rationalism*: by impoverishing, rather than enhancing, thought, it introduces fragility. Incompleteness, *half knowledge*, is always dangerous \n- **Traditions** provide an *aggregation of filtered collective knowledge* - also an idea from [[B_The Secret of Our Success]]\n- *Nonliterate people* also have their own 'science of the concrete', a holistic way of thinking about their environment in terms of objects and their 'secondary', sensuous qualities which are *not necessarily less coherent than many of our scientific approaches* and in many respects can be as rich or richer than ours \n- The sucker-nonsucker distinction \n\t- Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. People talk about payoff, exposure and consequences (risks and rewards). The **payoff is the most important thing, not the event itself**\n\t- Exposure is more important than knowledge; decision effects supersede logic \n- **We decide principally based on fragility, not probability**\n\t- To rephrase: we *decide principally based on fragility, not so much on True/False*\n\t- Almost all decisions have an asymmetric payoff, one side carrying a larger consequence than the other\n\n\n# Book V: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear\n## Chapter 18 - On the difference between a large stone and a thousand pebbles \n- A simple rule to detect the fragile p268\n\t- Central argument: why fragility is generally in the nonlinear and not in the linear \n\t- For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock\n\t\t- we are immune to the cumulative effect of small deviations / shocks of very small magnitude (if not we will break apart from walking)\n\t- For the antifragile, it too is grounded in nonlinearities: shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point)\n\t\t- Example: weightlifting, strength training: 100kg once more benefit than 1kg 100 times (to build muscle)\n- When to smile and when to frown p271 (convex and concave graphs)\n\t- Asymmetries: Gaining more than you lose (convex) vs losing more than you gain (concave)\n- Traffic in New York p274: examples of convexity effects - traffic jams\n\t- Basically, the marginal cost concept: 10% increase in cars leads to 50% increase in travel time \n\t- Another example: central banks printing money with no issue until a [[C~_Tipping point#]], jump in inflation \n\t- Injection of [[C_Redundancy]]\n- A 'balanced meal' p277: denial of *hormesis* (probably from earlier chapters). Consuming no protein on one day, catching up another day causes a different (better) physiological response, possibly because the deprivation, as a *stressor*, activates some pathways to facilitate subsequent absorption (or similar)\n\t- Health benefits are convex to speed (up to a point) - similar to the weightlifting point above \n- Small may be ugly, it is certainly less fragile p278\n\t- A *squeeze*: when people have no choice but to do something and right away, regardless of the costs ([[Farnam Street#FS forum highlights]] positioning for success: having buffers)\n\t- *Squeezes are exacerbated by size*. Despite [[C_Economies of scale]], size hurts you in times of stress - not a good idea to be large during difficult times \n\t\t- *Squeezes* are much more expensive (relative to size) for large corporations\n\t\t- *The gains from size are visible but the risks are hidden*, and some concealed risks bring frailties into the companies \n\t- Another example: market-moving trades from big companies ('slippage' in crypto DEX terms)\n\t- A nuance: it is the *size per segment* of a project that matters, not the entire project. If the project can be broken down (e.g. road building), less role for squeezes (small errors) vs monolithic projects that cannot be broken down (e.g. tunnel and bridge projects)\n\t- *It is completely wrong to use the calculus of benefits without including the probability of failure*. This seems commonsensical especially for an actuary, but still sounds so right \n\t- *Smooth functioning at regular times is different from the rough functioning at times of stress*\n\t- *Bottlenecks are the mothers of all squeezes*\n- Projects and prediction: why planes don't arrive early p283\n\t- [[C_Planning fallacy]] is the typical reason given for cost overruns in projects (overconfidence, etc.). But the counterpoint is that large-scale projects 150 years ago were completed on time, many even early (Empire State Building, Crystal Palace, etc.)\n\t- It was much a much more *linear* economy back then, less complex. Now we have more *nonlinearities*: asymmetries and convexities \n\t- 'Efficiency' and thee removal of buffers - people now sail too close to the wind. There are now many *bottlenecks* and thee project get as weak as the weakest link (negative convexity effect)\n\t- Therefore, it's not just a psychological problem of 'planning fallacy'. It is just the nonlinear structure of projects; errors add to the right end. If uncertainty were linear, we would see some projects completed extremely early, but we only see projects completed extremely late.

The surprising power of atomic habits \n- **Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement**. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\n- **Habits are a double-edged sword**. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\n- **Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a *critical threshold*.** The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\n- **An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system**. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\n#### Why small habits make a big difference: 1% better compounded\n- We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: **changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years**. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, **the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits**. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.\n - *Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight.* I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a **gradual evolution**, **a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs**. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.\n - The backbone of this book is my **four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward**—and the **four laws of behavior change** that evolve out of these steps. \n - It is so **easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis**. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\n - ==Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement==. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\n- ==A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination==. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems **insignificant in the moment**, but **over the span of moments** that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. **Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations**.\n- It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. **What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success**. You should be far more concerned with your current **trajectory** than with your current **results**. \n- ==Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits==\n\t- Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\n- If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is **follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line**. \n\t- Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.\n- ==Time magnifies the margin between success and failure==. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\n- **Habits are a double-edged sword**. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\n#### The plateau of latent potential \n- ==Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change==. \n\t- This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\n- Similarly, **habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance**. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a **Valley of Disappointment**. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a **hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.**\n- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the **==Plateau of Latent Potential==**. *Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.*\n- **When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success**. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—*when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress*—that makes the jump today possible.\n![[Pasted image 20210517130642.png|500]]\n#### Forget about goals, focus on [[systems]] instead \n- Results have very little to do with the goals you set, and nearly everything to do with the **systems** you follow \n- Goals are the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the **processes** that lead to those results. \n- Goals are good for setting a **direction**, but systems are best for **making progress**\n- Problems with thinking too much about goals and not enough time **designing your systems**\n\t- ==Winners and losers have the same goals==\n\t- Achieving a goal is only a **momentary change**\n\t- Goals **restrict your happiness**\n\t\t- The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that **you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.** For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. \n\t\t- Furthermore, goals create an **“either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment**. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. **It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success**. \n\t\t- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you **don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running**. And **a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.**\n\t- Goals are **at odds with long term progress**\n\t\t- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. \n#### A system of atomic habits \n- Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don't want to change, but because you have the **wrong system** for change \n- ==You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems==\n- Meaning of the phrase **atomic habits**—a regular practice or routine that is **not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power**; a component of the system of **compound growth**.\n\n\n### 2. How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)\n- **There are three levels of change**: outcome change, process change, and identity change.\n- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on **who you wish to become.**\n- **Your identity emerges out of your habits**. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\n- **Becoming the best version of yourself** requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\n- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can **change your beliefs about yourself.**\n#### Three layers of behavior change \n- The 3 levels\n\t- Changing your outcomes: like changing your results - losing weight, etc. Most goals associated with this level of change \n\t- Changing your process: changing your habits and systems - implementing new gym routine, developing meditation practice. Most habits associated with this level \n\t- Changing your identity: changing your beliefs - your worldview, self image, judgments about yourself and others. Most beliefs, assumptions and biases associated with this level \n- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is **when a habit becomes part of your identity.** It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.\n- **True behavior change is identity change.** You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. *Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.*\n\t- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\n\t- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\n\t- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.\n- On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. **Over the long run**, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that **your self-image gets in the way**. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity**.\n#### The two-step process to changing your identity \n- Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.”\n- **Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become**. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the **paradox of making small improvements**.\n\t- In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.\n- ==A simple two-step process to change your identity==\n\t1. Decide the type of person you want to be \n\t2. Prove it to yourself with small wins \n- **The formation of all habits is a feedback loop**, but it’s important to ==let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results==. The focus should always be on becoming that *type of person*, not getting a *particular outcome*.\n#### The real reason why habits matter \n- Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but **fundamentally they are not about *having something*.** They are about ***becoming someone***.\n- Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you **become the type of person you wish to be**. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.\n\n### 3. How to build better habits in 4 simple steps \n- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.\n- The **ultimate purpose of habits** is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.\n- Any habit can be broken down into a **feedback loop that involves four steps**: cue, craving, response, and reward.\n- **The Four Laws of Behavior Change** are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\n#### Why your brain builds habits \n- Habits are **mental shortcuts learned from experience**. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.\n- Habit formation is incredibly useful because ==the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain==. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.\n#### The science of how habits work: the habit loop \n- 4 steps: Cue, Craving, Response, Reward\n- 1\\. Cue: You are answering emails. 2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control. Solution phase 3. Response: You bite your nails. 4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.\n- **If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit**. \n\t- Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.\n\t- Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.\n\t- Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it.\n\t- And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. \n\t- Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\n- All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.\n#### The 4 laws of behavior change \n- **The Four Laws of Behavior Change** provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\n- ==Creating a good habit==\n\t- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\n\t- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. \n\t- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. \n\t- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\n- ==Breaking a bad habit==\n\t- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. \n\t- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. \n\t- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. \n\t- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\n\n## The 1st Law: Make it Obvious\n### 4. The man who didn't look right \n- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.\n- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.\n- The process of behavior change always starts with **awareness**. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\n- **==Pointing-and-Calling== raises your level of awareness** from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.\n- The **==Habits Scorecard==** is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.\n#### The habits scorecard\n- If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” \n- Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.\n- **Habits scorecard**: Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex: the labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. **There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems**. \n\t- All habits serve you in some way —even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise, categorize your habits by **how they will benefit you in the long run**. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.\n\t- “**Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?** Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad\n\n### 5. The best way to start a new habit: Implementation intentions, habit stacking\n- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is **make it obvious.**\n- The two most common cues are ==**time** and **location**.==\n- Creating an **implementation intention** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.\n\t- The implementation intention formula is: **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**\n- **Habit stacking** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.\n\t- The habit stacking formula is: **After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].**\n#### Implementation intentions \n- a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit\n- the format for creating an implementation intention is: **“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”**\n- Or, **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**\n\n#### Habit stacking: a simple plan to overhaul your habits\n- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a *current habit* you already do each day and then *stack* your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\n- Habit stacking is a special form of an **implementation intention**. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a **current habit**\n- The habit stacking formula is: **“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**\n- The key is to tie your desired behavior into *something you already do each day*. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the *natural momentum* that comes from one behavior leading into the next\n- The secret to creating a successful habit stack is **selecting the right cue** to kick things off.\n- Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. **The specificity is important**\n- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to **make it obvious**. Strategies like **implementation intentions** and **habit stacking** are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.\n\n### 6. Motivation is overrated; *environment* often matters more \n- Small changes in **context** can lead to large changes in behavior over time.\n- Every habit is initiated by a **cue**. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.\n- Make the cues of good habits **obvious** in your environment.\n- Gradually, your habits become **associated** not with a single trigger but with the **entire context** surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.\n- It is easier to build new habits in a **new environment** because you are not fighting against old cues.\n#### How to design your environment for success \n- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.\n- The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is **vision**. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that **half of the brain’s resources are used on vision**. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that **visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior**. For this reason, a ==small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do==. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\n- This also means you don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\n- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the **==cue==** a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have **multiple cues**\n-  By **sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings**, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day\n-  Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because **we rarely do it**. *Most people live in a world others have created for them*. But you can **alter the spaces** where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to **take back control** and become the architect of your life. Be the **==designer==** of your world and not merely the consumer of it.\n\n#### The context is the cue \n- The cues that trigger a habit can start out **very specific**, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the **entire context** surrounding the behavior.\n- It is easier to associate a **new habit** with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.\n- Whenever possible, **avoid mixing the context of one habit with another**. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits— and the **easier ones will usually win out**. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.\n- A **stable environment** where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\n### 7. The secret to *self control* (against bad habits)\n- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is **make it invisible**.\n- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\n- People with high self-control tend to **spend less time in tempting situations**. ==It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.==\n- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to **reduce exposure to the cue** that causes it.\n- **Self-control is a short-term strategy**, not a long-term one.\n#### Making it invisible \n- When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals **aren’t all that different from those who are struggling**. Instead, “disciplined” people are **better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control**. In other words, they **==spend less time in tempting situations==.**\n- The **people with the best self-control** are typically the ones who **need to use it the least**. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is **not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a ==more disciplined environment==**.\n- **Bad habits are autocatalytic:** the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a **downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits**.\n-  **==“Cue-induced wanting”:==** an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. **Once you notice something, you begin to want it**.\n- ==**Simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy**==. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the **short-run**, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the **long-run**, **we become a product of the environment that we live in**. *To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.*\n- A more reliable approach is to **cut bad habits off at the source**. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to **==reduce exposure to the cue==** that causes it.\n- ==Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one==. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent **optimizing your environment.** This is the secret to self-control. ==Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.==\n\n## The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive\n### 8. How to make a habit irresistible: temptation bundling \n- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is **make it attractive.**\n- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\n- **Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop**. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.\n- It is the ==anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action==. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\n- ==Temptation bundling== is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to **pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.**\n\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.\n#### The dopamine-driven feedback loop \n- Dopamine is released **not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you *anticipate* it**. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, **so does your motivation to act.**\n\t- Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. \n- It is the ==anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action==.\n- Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you **receive** a reward is the **same** system that is activated when you **anticipate** a reward. This is one reason the **anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it**. Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”\n\t- As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. \n![[Pasted image 20210525084929.png|500]]\n\n#### How to use *temptation bundling* to make your habits more attractive\n- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as **Premack’s Principle: “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”** Even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.\n- You can even **combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy** we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: \n\t- After[CURRENT HABIT], I will[HABIT I NEED]. \n\t- After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\n- Temptation bundling is one way to create a **heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want**. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.\n\n\n\n### 9. The role of family and friends in shaping your habits\n- The **culture** we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\n\t- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.\n- We tend to **imitate the habits of three social groups:** the **close** (family and friends), the **many** (the tribe), and the **powerful** (those with status and prestige).\n- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to **join a culture** where (1) your **desired behavior is the normal behavior** and (2) you **already have something in common** with the group.\n- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\n- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\n\n#### The seductive pull of social norms \n- One of the deepest human desires is to belong. This ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behaviour\n- We **imitate the habits of 3 groups** in particular: the close, the many, the powerful\n- **Imitating the close**\n\t- the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits\n\t- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to **join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior**. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” **Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself**. You’ll rise together.\n\t- In addition, join a culture where **you already have something in common with the group**\n\t- **Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe**. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. **Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit.** We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s **friendship and community** that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.\n- **Imitating the many**\n\t- There is tremendous internal pressure to **comply with the norms of the group**. The **reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth**. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\n\t- When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n- **Imitating the powerful**\n- We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. **Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.**\n\n### 10. How to find and fix the causes of bad habits\n- The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is **make it unattractive.**\n- Every behavior has a **surface level craving** and a **deeper underlying motive**.\n- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\n- The cause of your habits is actually the **prediction** that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.\n- Highlight the **benefits of avoiding a bad habit** to make it **seem unattractive**.\n- Habits are **attractive** when we **associate them with positive feelings** and **unattractive** when we **associate them with negative feelings**. Create a **motivation ritual** by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\n\n#### Where cravings come from \n- A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. \n- Habits are all about **associations**. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. \n- Your brain is continually absorbing **information** and noticing **cues** in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a **simulation** and makes a **prediction** about what to do in the next moment. ==Every action is preceded by a prediction==\n- **Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions**. Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we ==interpret== the events that happen to us, not necessarily the ==objective reality== of the events themselves. \n- the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to **address your fundamental underlying motives**. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a **craving** to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. **Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings,** and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\n#### How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits \n- You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to **associate them with a positive experience.** Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. \n- **Changing just one word**: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\n- The key point is that ==both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose==.\n- Reframing your habits to **highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks** is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and **make a habit seem more attractive**.\n- [[0007 Mindfulness]] ==Meditation==: Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next **distraction** inevitably pops into your mind. You can **transform frustration into delight** when you realize that **each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath**. Distraction is a good thing because *you need distractions to practice meditation.*\n- ==Pregame jitters==. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings **positively**, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can **reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”**\n- \n## The 3rd Law: Make it Easy \n### 11. Walk slowly, but never backward\n- The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is **make it easy**.\n- The most effective form of learning is **practice, not planning**.\n- Focus on **taking action**, not being in motion.\n- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively **more automatic through repetition**.\n- The **amount of time** you have been performing a habit is **not as important** as the ***number of times*** you have performed it.\n#### Getting started, motion vs action \n- It is easy to get **bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change**: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we **never get around to taking action**. As Voltaire once wrote, **“The best is the enemy of the good.”**\n- Motion vs action: Most of us are **experts at avoiding criticism**. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into **motion** rather than taking **action**: you want to **delay failure.**\n- Motion makes you **feel like you’re getting things done**. But really, you’re just *preparing* to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of **procrastination**, you need to change something. ==You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.==\n- If you want to master a habit, the ==key is to start with **repetition**, not perfection==. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: ==you just need to get your reps in.==\n#### How long it actually takes to form a new habit \n- Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that **simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps** you can take to encoding a new habit. **[[C_Active recall]] similar: active practice vs passive learning**, action vs motion \n- One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How **many** does it take to form a new habit?” That is, **how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic?**\n![[Pasted image 20210529090752.png|500]]\n\n### 12. The law of least effort\n- Human behavior follows the **Law of Least Effort**. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\n- Create an **environment** where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.\n- **Reduce the friction** associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.\n- **Increase the friction** associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.\n- **Prime your environment** to make future actions easier.\n#### The law \n- Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, **our real motivation is to be lazy and to do *what is convenient*.** And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.\n- Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the **Law of Least Effort**, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\n- In a sense, ==every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want==. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. **You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.** The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to **make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it**. If you can make your good habits more **convenient**, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\n#### How to achieve more with less effort \n- One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice **environment design**.\n- If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life.\n- Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.\n#### Prime the environment for future use\n- There are many ways to **prime your environment** so it’s ready for immediate use. Simple ways to make the good habit **the path of least resistance**. The inverse is true for bad habits \n- It is remarkable **how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behaviour**\n- **Redesign your life** so the **actions that matter most** are also **the actions that are easiest to do**.\n\n### 13. How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule \n- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but **continue to impact your behavior** for minutes or hours afterward.\n- Many habits occur at **decisive moments**—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.\n- The **Two-Minute Rule** states, “**When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.**”\n- The more you **ritualize the beginning of a process**, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.\n- **Standardize before you optimize.** You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.\n#### Decisive moments\n- Researchers estimate that **40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit**. This is already a substantial percentage, but the **true influence** of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are **automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow**. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also **shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward**.\n- Habits are like the **entrance ramp to a highway**. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be **easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.**\n- ==Every day, there are a handful of **moments** that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as **decisive moments**==. These choices are a fork in the road.\n\t- The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. \n\t- The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. \n\t- The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game controller. \n![[Pasted image 20210531090923.png|500]]\n- We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why **mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important**. ==Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a **few** habitual choices that determine the path you take==. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\n#### The two-minute rule \n- **When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do**\n- The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start \n- What you want is a 'gateway habit' that naturally leads you down a more productive path \n- The point is not to do one thing. It is to **master the habit of showing up**\n- The more you **ritualize the beginning of a process**, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.\n- We rarely think about change this way because **everyone is consumed by the end goal**. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\n\n### 14. How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible \n- The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is **make it difficult.**\n- A **commitment device** is a **choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.**\n- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to **automate your habits.**\n- **==Onetime choices==**—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.\n- Using **technology** to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.\n\n#### A commitment device\n- Sometimes success is **less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard**. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: **make it difficult.** \n- If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a **commitment device**: a choice you make in the **present** that controls your actions in the **future**. It is a way to **lock in future behavior**, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.\n- Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to **take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation**.\n- The key is to **change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.** \n\t- If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call.\n\t- When the time comes to act, **the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.**\n- Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll **do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present.**\n\n#### How to automate a habit and never think about it again \n- The best way to break a bad habit is to **make it impractical to do**. Increase the **friction** until you don’t even have the option to act\n- Some actions—like installing a cash register—**pay off again and again**. These ==onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time==. I’m fascinated by the idea that a **single choice** can deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term habits\n- When you automate as much of your life as possible, ==you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.== Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth.\n- **Locking yourself out of social media:** One of the biggest surprises was **how quickly I adapted**. Within the first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. **After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much easier to eat the healthy stuff**.\n\n## The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying \n### 15. The cardinal rule of behavior change \n- The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.\n- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.\n- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.\n- **The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided**.\n- To get a habit to stick you need to **feel immediately successful**— *even* if it’s in a *small way.*\n- The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be **performed this time**. The fourth law of behavior change —make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be **repeated next time**.\n\n#### Making it satisfying\n- We are **more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying**. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—==even minor ones== like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\n- **the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is (immediately) rewarded is repeated. What is (immediately) punished is avoided.** You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.\n- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for **immediate satisfaction**.\n\n#### The mismatch between immediate and delayed rewards (delayed gratification)\n- **The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.** It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment. Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new.\n- Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as **==time inconsistency==**. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time. **You value the present more than the future**. \n\t- Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.\n- Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often **misaligned**. With our **bad** habits, the immediate outcome usually feels **good**, but the ultimate outcome feels **bad**. With **good** habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is **unenjoyable**, but the ultimate outcome feels **good**\n- ==the costs of your **good** habits are in the **present**. The costs of your **bad** habits are in the **future**.==\n- As a general rule, the **more immediate pleasure** you get from an action, the more strongly you should **question** whether it aligns with your long-term goals\n-  Updating the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is **immediately** rewarded is repeated. What is **immediately** punished is avoided.\n-  Our preference for **instant gratification** reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, **most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction**. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. **If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff**. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\n-  **it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification**—but you need to work with the grain of human\nnature, not against it. The best way to do this is to **add a little bit of immediate pleasure** to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\n#### How to turn instant gratification to your advantage \n- The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to **feel successful—even if it’s in a small way**. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.\n- What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the **ending of a behavior**. The **==ending of any experience== is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases**. You want the **ending of your habit to be satisfying**. The best approach is to use **reinforcement**, which refers to the process of using an **immediate reward** to increase the rate of a behavior. \n\t- **Habit stacking**, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to **start**. \n\t- **Reinforcement** ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you **finish**.\n- it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new **identity** to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps **maintain motivation in the short term** while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\n- **Change is easy when it is enjoyable.**\n### 16. How to stick with good habits every day \n- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.\n- A **habit tracker** is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.\n- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.\n- Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.\n- **Never miss twice.** If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.\n- Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.\n\n#### How to keep your habits on track: with a habit tracker \n- Habit tracking is powerful because **it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change**. It simultaneously makes a behavior **obvious**, **attractive**, and **satisfying**.\n- Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re **focused on the process rather than the result**. You’re not fixated on getting six- pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the *type of person* who doesn’t miss workouts.\n- In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides **visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become**, which is a delightful form of **immediate** and **intrinsic** gratification.\n- manual tracking should be limited to your **most important habits.** It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.\n- Record each measurement **immediately after the habit occurs.** The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.\n\t- The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\n#### ==How to quickly recover when your habits break down==\n#important \n- **Never miss twice**. \n- **The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing one is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit**\n- This is a distinguishing feature between **winners and losers**. **Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.** The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\n-  this principle is so important that I’ll **stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like**. Too often, we fall into an **all-or-nothing cycle** with our habits. The **problem** is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, *then you shouldn’t do it at all.*\n-  You don’t realize ==how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days==. **Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you.** If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”\n- This is why the **“bad” workouts are often the most important ones**. Sluggish days and bad workouts **maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days**. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.\n- Furthermore, it’s **not always about *what happens during the workout***. It’s about **being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts**. It’s ==easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope==. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it **reaffirms your identity.**\n#### Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit\n - The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that **we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it**.\n - This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, **we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior**.\n - his is sometimes referred to as **[[C_Goodhart's Law|Goodhart’s Law]]**. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, ==“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”== Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.\n-  it’s crucial to **keep habit tracking in its proper place**. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to something entirely different.\n### 17. How an accountability partner can change everything \n- The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying.\n- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is **painful or unsatisfying.**\n- An accountability partner can create an **immediate cost to inaction**. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.\n- A **habit contract** can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.\n- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.\n#### Adding an immediate cost to a bad habit \n- Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. \n- The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an **instant cost** to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\n- **We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon**. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to ==increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior==. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.\n- We’ll **jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.**\n- A straightforward way to **add an immediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract.**\n\n#### The habit contract\n- To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\n\n## Advanced Tactics\n### 18. The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)\n- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to **choose the right field of competition**.\n- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.\n- **Genes** cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.\n- Habits are easier when they **align with your natural abilities**. Choose the habits that best suit you.\n- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.\n- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.\n#### Choosing the right field of competition \n- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to **choose the right field of competition**. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.\n- The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\n- In short: **genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity**. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to **direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability**.\n- The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding your personality.\n#### How your personality influences your habits \n- Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything.\n- The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the ==“[[Big Five]],”== which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.\n\t1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.\n\t2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easy going and spontaneous.\n\t3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n\t4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.\n\t5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.\n- Build habits that **work for your personality**. You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.\n\n#### How to find a game where the odds are in your favour \n- In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, **any area can become challenging**. At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skillset.\n- The **explore/exploit trade-off**\n- In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent\n- The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. **If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career— it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it**. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.\n- Questions to continually ask \n\t- What feels like fun to me, but work to others? \n\t- What makes me lose track of time? ([[C_Flow]])\n\t- Where do I get greater returns than the average person? \n\t- What comes naturally to me? \n- We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.\n- When you can’t win by being better, you can **win by being different**. By **combining** your skills, you **reduce the level of competition,** which makes it **easier to stand out**. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by **rewriting the rules**. A good player works hard to win the game *everyone else is playing*. A great player ==creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses==.\n- Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you\n\n#### How to get the most out of your genes\n- One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. **Work hard on the things that come easy**.\n\n### 19. The Goldilocks Rule: how to stay motivated in life and work \n- The **Goldilocks Rule** states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are **right on the edge of their current abilities.**\n- The greatest threat to success is not failure but **boredom**.\n- As habits become routine, they become **less interesting and less satisfying**. We get bored.\n- **Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated**. It’s the **ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting** that makes the difference.\n- Professionals **stick to the schedule**; amateurs let life get in the way.\n\n#### The Goldilocks Rule \n- How do we design habits that pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for many years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that **the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “==just manageable difficulty==.”**\n- The human brain loves a challenge, **but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty**. \n- The Goldilocks Rule states that **humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the ==edge of their current abilities==**. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\n- Once a habit **has been established**, it’s important to continue to **advance in small ways**. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a [[C_Flow|flow]] state.\n\n#### How to stay focus when you get bored working on your goals \n- “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”\n- Successful people face the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom\n- Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster than that. Hitting your habit a few times in a row and *letting one day slip doesn't feel like much*. Things are going well. It's *easy to rationalise taking a day off because you're in a good place*. **The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.**\n- \"Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly\"\n- The **sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure**: half of the time you get what you want. One of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you're already interested in a habit, working on challenges of **just manageable difficulty** is a good way to **keep things interesting**\n- Variable rewards or not, **no habit will stay interesting forever**. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self improvement: **you have to fall in love with boredom**\n- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. \n- \"There have been a lot of sets that I haven't felt like finishing, but I've never regretted doing the workout\"\n- The only way to become excellent is to be **endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.**\n\n### 20. The downside of creating good habits \n- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors\n- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery \n- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time\n- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it \n#### The downside\n- Habits are necessary, but not sufficient, for mastery. Need a combination of **automatic habits + deliberate practice**\n- After one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin building the next habit \n- **Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalised the skill, then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development**\n- Each habit unlocks the next level of performance \n#### Mastering one habit \n![[Pasted image 20210611085636.png|500]]\n- It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill - right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable - that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency\n- Solution: establish a system for **reflection and review**\n#### How to review and make adjustments\n- [[Journalling]]: Reflection and review enables the long term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalisations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday. \n- Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review, and the process does not have to be complex\n- Review the day and search for **areas that can be improved**\n- Executives and investors who keep a **decision journal** in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of the month or year to see where they were correct or wrong \n- Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about **fine-tuning them**. Reflection and review ensures you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary \n- Reflection brings a **sense of perspective**: daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away (too much feedback). Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in a mirror from a conversational distance - seeing the important changes without losing sight of the bigger picture\n##### Integrity report \n- 2 primary modes of reflection and review: Annual Review, and **Integrity Report**\n- The Integrity Report helps me realise where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. To revisit core values, consider whether I have been living in accordance with them\n- Three questions\n\t- What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n\t- How am I living and working with integrity right now? \n\t- How can I set a higher standard in the future? \n- These reports **prevent the gradual slide that happens when I don't pay close attention**\n#### How to break the habits that hold you back \n- The more sacred an idea is to us - the more deeply it is tied to our identity - the more strongly we will defend it against criticism \n- Solution: avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are\n- The key to mitigating losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes \n- A lack of self awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote\n\n## Conclusion: The secret to results that last\n- The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, but a thousand of them. A bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system \n- Eventually, if you stick with it, you **hit a tipping point**. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working **for you rather than against you**\n- Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. \n- If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. It is your **system**. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because **you have the wrong system for change**. \n![[Pasted image 20210613094241.png|500]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_Deep-Work":{"title":"Deep Work","content":"\n[Books](notes/Books.md) #book \n\n## The book in 3 sentences\n- Deep work is more powerful than most people realise\n- To succeed in this increasingly competitive knowledge economy, you need to prioritise deep work over shallow work (which is easily replicable by others)\n- A bunch of actionable steps in Part 2 that show how to make Deep Work a part of your professional life \n\t- Work deeply \n\t- Embrace boredom in this distracted world\n\t- Quit social media, plan every minute of your time \n\t- Drain the shallows\n## Impressions\nOne of the first few self help books of this nature, one of the classics that I have been going to on and off.

It is a **simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask, ==what makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?==**. In fact **==it is the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer==**\n\u003e - ... the recognition that **a deep work habit requires you to ==treat your time with respect==**. A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: ***Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday***. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.\n\nOn intentionality of how you spend your time (even **leisure** time): \n \u003e- **Figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin**. **Structured hobbies** provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate **specific actions with specific goals** to fill your time. A set program of reading, à la Bennett, where you spend regular time each night making progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is, of course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.\n\u003e- If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, **you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed**, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in **semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing**.\n\n---\n## Actionable steps (from Part 2)\n### [[B_Deep Work Rule 1 - Work deeply|Rule #1: Work deeply]]\n- **Decide on your depth philosophy**\n- **Ritualise**: general questions for any effective ritual\n\t- **Where you will work and for how long**\n\t- **How you will work once you start to work:** rules and processes to keep efforts structured, e.g. ban on internet use, or **metric** like words produced\n\t- **How you will support your work:** e.g. cup of good coffee, food, environmental factors\n- **Make grand gestures**\n- **Don't work alone**\n- **Execute like a business** (tough part: executing the strategy) - 4DX framework from Christensen \n\t- **Discipline #1: Focus on the wildly important**\n\t\t- Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours\n\t\t- Have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits \n\t- **Discipline #2: Act on the lead measures**\n\t\t- Fundamental premise of 4DX: [[C_execution is more difficult than strategising]]\n\t\t- Lag measures too late; lead measures measure new behaviours that will drive success on lag measures \n\t\t- ==Time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to your wildly important goal==\n\t- **Discipline #3: Keep a compelling scoreboard**\n\t\t- Also to calibrate expectations for number of hours of deep work needed per result\n\t- **Discipline #4: Create a cadence of accountability**\n\t\t- [[C_Weekly, quarterly review and plan]]: making a plan for the workweek ahead (see rule #4)\n\t\t- Celebrate good weeks, understand what led to bad weeks, how to ensure good score for days ahead\n- **Shutdown ritual**\n\t- [[B_Deep Work Rule 1 - Work deeply#3 possible reasons why downtime is so important|3 reasons why downtime is so important]]\n\t\t- Downtime aids insights \n\t\t- Downtime helps recharge energy needed to work deeply \n\t\t- The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important (debatable...

We need the habit of pausing before action and asking, **what makes the most sense right now?**\n- Every minute of the day should be part of a block, giving every minute of your workday a job\n- If your schedule is disrupted, you should, at the next available moment, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day \n\t- On some days, you might rewrite your schedule 6 times. **Don't despair** if that happens.

These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, **logistical-style tasks**, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.\n- Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad) is **exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity** for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing **depth**\n- Deep work is a skill that has great value today\n\t- Learning: We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.\n\t- The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, **its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless**—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is **mediocre**, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to **find a better alternative online.** \n\t\t- Whether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.\n- **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly **rare** at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly **valuable** in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\n- Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.\n## [[B_Deep Work Part 1 - The Idea|Part 1: The Idea]]\n## Part 2: The Rules\n- [[B_Deep Work Rule 1 - Work deeply|Rule #1: Work deeply]]\n- [[B_Deep Work Rule 2 - Embrace boredom|Rule #2: Embrace boredom]]\n- [[B_Deep Work Rule 3 - Quit social media|Rule #3: Quit social media]]\n- [[B_Deep Work Rule 4 - Drain the shallows|Rule #4: Drain the shallows]]\n\n\n## Conclusion\nDeep work is way more powerful than most people understand.\n\nThe deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully now that you’ve finished this book, you agree too.","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_Good-Economics-for-Hard-Times":{"title":"Good Economics for Hard Times","content":"\n[Books](notes/Books.md)\nDate summarised: WIP\n## The book in 3 sentences\n## Impressions\n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\nWhat I have been always doing\n\n## The End of Growth? \n- The big question: what does growth happen? Why does it seem like growth has slowed down / stopped in developed nations? What accounts for growth differences in different countries?\n- The Glorious Thirty \n\t- Concept of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), to explain differences in productivity that cannot be measured \n\t- Workers may be able to produce more output today compared to previously given the same machines and hours. Why? They become more efficient... Maybe better processes? 'TFP' increasing when we discover new ways to reduce waste / time in producing things \n- The Less Glorious Forty \n\t- After 1973 (oil crisis era), growth seemed to have stopped. There seems to have been a lot of innovation (technological age) without corresponding economic growth - why? And will it return? \n\t- Perhaps GDP is not the right thing to measure in the first place. It doesn't capture things like 'joy'\n- Is Growth Over?\n\t- Gordon vs Mokyr\n\t- Gordon believes growth is over, and all the new tech (machine learning, AI, etc) have done nothing for growth \n\t- Mokyr is more optimistic\n\t- [[2_Fourth industrial revolution]]\n\t- Conclusion: there could be no way of finding out other than waiting. \n- The war of the flowers \n\t- GDP values only things that can be priced and marketed.\n\t- The recent slowdown in measured productivity growth coincides with the explosion of social media. How to measure the impact on wellbeing? \n- Growth happens\n\t- p160 The most showy breakthroughs will always be in the more advanced countries, but most technology upgrading is just moving from day-before-yesterday's tech to yesterday's. This is typically easier than pushing the frontier, precisely because it has already been done and we know exactly how to do it; just pulling things off the shelf rather than coming up with something new. Related: [[C_Invest in things that take you from 0 to 1]] \n\t- Exogenous growth model: driven by outside forces or effects; acknowledging our inability to do anything about the long-run growth rate. Solow thinks growth is beyond our control \n- Give me a lever\n\t- p161 The reason why India was poor could not be all because of a shortage of skills and capital. 'Intrinsic productivity' of capital could be lower in India? \n\t- Countries are poor in substantial part because they *make less good of the resources they have*. The question is *why?*\n\t- [[Communism]]: Marx viewed that capitalism was doomed because the insatiable greed of the capitalist class in the pursuit of more and more capital would drive the return on capital ([[C_Diminishing returns]]) into the ground ('falling rate of profit') and precipitate the crises that eventually end capitalism \n\t\t- Counterexamples: economies of scale (like Amazon)\n\t- p164: Silicon Valley environment - cross pollination of ideas in the grouping of high-skilled people in the same industry \n- Growth stories p165\n\t- Talking about growth: very high level - 'telescoping an incredible amount of real-world complexity into as few building blocks as possible'\n\t\t- Difficult to map abstractions onto the real world [[C_Level of abstraction]]? From individuals to whole economy (which the theories are based on)\n\t\t- It is also hard to compare economy to economy as they are not very comparable, many differences \n\t\t- Basically, what we observe can have many reasons (correlation and causation), so it's hard to draw conclusions \n\t- Basically, the obsession with growth may be barking up the wrong tree\n\t\t- It is very difficult to *measure* growth in the first place. It is even harder to know *what drives it*, and therefore to make *policy* to make growth happen\n\t\t- So maybe economists should stop focusing on growth, instead the most important question (in rich countries) is how to improve the *quality of life* of the average citizen \n- The million dollar plant p167\n\t- How to attract growth in a city? Offer more incentives? Build infrastructure?\n\t- Growth in a region is different from national growth because it can cannibalise growth in the rest of the economy \n- Charter cities p170\n\t- Urbanisation in India: cities grow horizontally, by outgrowing former boundaries, rather than vertically through taller and better-quality buildings \n\t- This form of urbanisation just increases pollution travel times - not business friendly or liveable, so it's actually more difficult to attract talent, and limits the 'concentration' effect and cross pollination of ideas \n- Creative destruction p172\n\t- In the real world, production of new ideas is a much more fraught affair. Many marketable ideas are produced by *firms*, and firms tend to be possessive about their discoveries. *Industrial espionage* is a major industry today, and so is its foil, *patent law*","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_How-to-Read-a-Book":{"title":"How to Read a Book","content":"[Books](notes/Books.md)\nDate summarised: WIP\n## The book in 3 sentences\n## Impressions\n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n- 2022.07.23 Reading for information vs reading for understanding: this book is about reading for *understanding*\n\n### 7: X-raying a book\n- *Every book has a skeleton between its covers.

The greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the desire to hurry up the process. Master the basics first. *Love learning for its own sake. Anyone who would spend 10 years absorbing the techniques and conventions of their field, trying them out, mastering them, exploring and personalising them, would inevitably find their authentic voice and give birth to something unique and expressive.* Similar to [[~B_Antifragile#Chapter 16 A lesson in disorder]]\n- The Fact of Great Yield\n\t- You must read journals and books from all different fields. Sometimes you will find an interesting anomaly in an unrelated discipline that would have implications for your own. Keep your mind completely open\n\t- Another similar reminder to [[~B_Antifragile#Chapter 16 A lesson in disorder]], going farther and wider in the research and not being too *directed / task oriented* in finding answers. Curiosity may be the key \n- The high end p230\n\t- We often get into *technical lock*, i.e. locked into seeing every problem in the same way especially after trying to master a complex skill. We lose sight of the bigger picture, the purpose of what we are doing, and sink into *tunnel vision*\n\t- We must always connect the problem/project to *something larger* - a bigger question, an overarching idea, an inspiring goal. Always return to the larger purpose and goal whenever the project becomes stale. This bigger idea governs the smaller paths of investigation \n- **[[C_Evolutionary hijacking]]** p235\n\t- Creativity resembles a process known in nature as *evolutionary hijacking*, where accidents and contingencies play an enormous role. \n\t\t- e.g. bird feathers were originally to keep them warm, then used to help them fly\n\t\t- e.g. maybe language itself developed as a strictly social tool, then hijacked as a means of reasoning, making human consciousness itself a product of an accident \n\t- What constitutes true creativity is the openness and adaptability of the spirit, looking at something through different angles \n- Dimensional thinking p242\n\t- We normally work with abstractions and simplifications, reducing highly complex and interactive problems into modules, formulas, tidy statistics. This yields only a partial picture of reality, and miss the living, breathing element. \n\t- You want to instead not be in a hurry, preferring the 'holistic approach'. Look at the object of study from as many angles as possible, giving your thoughts added dimensions. Assume that the parts of any whole interact with one another and cannot be completely separated. Get as close to the complicated truth and reality of your object of study as possible\n\t- Career wise what does this mean? Is this an argument to go as detailed as possible rather than breadth? But also, in my job, I'm looking at the issue 'from as many angles as possible', so that's not a bad thing. \n- Alchemical creativity and the unconscious p242\n\t- The idea of alchemy: *interaction of opposites* - by reconciling opposites, the alchemist believes he can discover the deepest secrets of nature, gain the power to create something out of nothing, and turn dust into gold \n\t- Our culture depends in many ways on the creation of standards and conventions we must all adhered to. These conventions are often expressed in terms of *opposites*, like good and evil, etc. These opposites give our world a sense of cohesion and comfort. But life is more fluid and complex than that; hard to fit all desires and experiences into these tidy categories\n\t- Thinking of everything in black and white / opposites limits our creativity. Explore the unconscious and contradictory parts of your personality\n\t- Contradictions contain a rich mine of information about reality that is deeper and more cmplex than immediately perceived \n\n### VI: Fuse the Intuitive with the Rational: Mastery \n- p265 We must do what we can to cultivate a greater memory capacity - one of the most important skills in our technologically oriented environment\n\t- We should not simply look for entertainment and distractions in our spare time. Instead take up hobbies - a game, musical instrument or foreign language - that bring us pleasure but also offer us the chance to strengthen our memory capacities and flexibility of our brain. We can train ourselves to process large amounts of information without feeling anxious or overtaxed \n\t- 2022.08.26 Chess is a 'game' that trains my memory although it is perhaps not directly transferrable. But at least it is fun and instils discipline lol. A good form of relaxation... #thought \n\t- 2022.08.26 Reading and summarising books also is another type of 'hobby'... \n- Seems to be an argument for [[B_Range]] and the interconnectedness of different subjects, etc. All these require some form of intuition \n- *The brain of a Master is so richly interconnected that it comes to resemble the physical world, and becomes a vibrant ecosystem in which all forms of thinking associate and connect. This growing similarity between the brain and complex life itself represents the ultimate return to reality*\n- Need intense focus \n##### Strategies for attaining mastery ","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_Meditations":{"title":"Meditations","content":"[Books](notes/Books.md) | [Stoicism](notes/2_Stoicism.md)\n\nGregory Hayes translation \n- 2.5 Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on **doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness**, tenderly, willingly, with justice.

It is the ability to integrate broadly \n\n#### 2: How the wicked world was made \n- **The modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. The rest can be more easily automated**\n- Econ majors do well: since economics is a broad field by nature\n- Detailed prior knowledge is less important than a way of thinking \n- The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be **automated**, while great rewards will accrue to those who can **take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one**.\n\n#### 3: When less of the same is more \n#### 4: Learning, fast and slow\n- ==Desirable difficulties as opposed to rote / traditional learning - in support of Range==\n-  [[Generation effect]]: one of the [[C_Desirable difficulties]] - struggling to generate an answer on your own can enhance learning, even if it was (wildly) wrong, and enhances subsequent learning. \n- [[C_Learning is most efficient in LT when inefficient in ST]]\n- [[Interleaving]]: another one of the [[C_Desirable difficulties]]\n- The most successful **problem solvers** spend mental energy **figuring out what problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it**, rather than jumping in with memorised procedures \n- Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems \n\n#### 5: Thinking outside experience \n- ==Deep analogical thinking and across different contexts/domains - an argument for Range==\n- Kepler is a good example of thinking entirely outside his domain \n- **Deep analogical thinking** is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. It is a powerful tool for **solving wicked problems**\n- **Thinking relationally** is the key to humans' success, an extension of just depending on [[C_Direct experience]]\n- In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.\n- All forces align to incentivize a head start and early, narrow specialization, even if that is a poor long-term strategy.\n\n#### 6: The trouble with too much grit \n- ==Concept of [[C_Match quality]], and knowing when to quit==\n- For professionals who did switch, whether they specialized early or late, **switching was a good idea**. “You lose a good fraction of your skills, so there’s a hit,” Malamud said, “but you **do actually have higher growth rates after switching.**” Regardless of when specialization occurred, switchers capitalized on experience to identify better matches.\n- The expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. **It is ideal.** They have **less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward**, and that have high informational value.\n- Winners quit fast and often when they detect that a plan is not the best fit, and do not feel bad about it\n- **Knowing when to quit** is a huge strategic advantage. Just must know when switching is simply a failure of perseverance, or astute recognition that better matches are available\n- **\"Olympic athletes need to understand that the rules for life are different from the rules of sports\"** - same for me, exams (single overarching goal) vs facing the wider world; must \"devote time to something that has no clear end goal\"\n#### 7: Flirting with your possible selves\n- ==Dark Horses and their winding path to success - we have many selves and we do not stay the same; these selves are discovered through 'living' and not theory==\n- Keeping your mind wide open will take **something from every new experience**\n- **Dark horses**: those who take a winding path to be 'successful' - much more common than we'd expect. They were told 'getting off their initial path was so risky'\n\t- They look for **match quality** and **not whether they are going to fall behind**\n- Because **[[C_We do not stay the same over time|personality changes more than we expect with time, experience, and different contexts]]**, we are **ill-equipped to make ironclad long-term goals** when our past consists of little time, few experiences, and a narrow range of contexts. Each **“story of me” continues to evolve.**\n- Career goals that once felt safe and certain can appear ludicrous when examined in the light of more self-knowledge. Our work preferences and our life preferences do not stay the same, because **we do not stay the same**\n- We learn who we are only by living, and not before \n- \"Virtually every good thing in my life I can trace back to a misfortune... **[[C_There is good in everything, if only we look for it|You don't know what's good and what's bad when things happen]]**... You have to wait to find out\"\n\n#### 8: The outsider advantage \n- ==Being able to connect the dots as an outsider==\n- \"Knowledge is a double-edged sword. It allows you to do some things, but it also makes you blind to other things that you could do.\"\n- The more information specialists create, the more opportunity exists for curious dilettantes to contribute by **merging strands of widely available but disparate information—undiscovered public knowledge**, as Don Swanson called it. The larger and more easily accessible the library of human knowledge, the more chances for inquisitive patrons to make connections at the cutting edge.\n\n#### 9: Lateral thinking with withered technology \n- ==Lateral thinking; aim to be T-shaped, or even π-shaped, instead of a narrowly focused specialist (fewer may suffice in this world). Also, frogs vs birds analogy==\n- **Lateral thinking**: reimagining of information in new contexts, including drawing together seemingly disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses\n- Dyson: **Birds** (big picture thinkers, see further) vs **frogs** (deeper). Need both birds and frogs, but now science is full of frogs \n- For narrowly focused specialists in technical fields, they are still absolutely critical, but their work is widely accessible, so fewer suffice. Also, there are massively increased opportunities for **connectors and polymathic innovators**, combining things in new ways and being broader than a specialist\n- **T-shaped person**: one who has more breadth than an I shaped person. **T people can go to the I people with ==questions== to create the trunk for the T**\n- Even more extreme: “π-shaped people” who dive in and out of multiple specialties. “Look for wide-ranging interests,” they advised. “Look for multiple hobbies and avocations\"\n\n#### 10: Fooled by expertise \n- ==[[C_Foxes v hedgehogs]] (from [[B_Superforecasting]]): foxes do well in wicked environments ,where experience alone does not improve performance==\n- **Hedgehog** experts were deep but narrow... they fashioned tidy theories of how the world works through the single lens of their specialty, and then **bent every event to fit them**. Outcomes did not matter; **they were proven right by both successes and failures**, and burrowed further into their ideas. It made them **outstanding at predicting the past, but dart-throwing chimps at predicting the future**. \n- The foxes, meanwhile, “draw from an eclectic array of traditions, and accept ambiguity and contradiction,” Tetlock wrote. Where hedgehogs represented narrowness, **foxes** ranged outside a single discipline or theory and embodied breadth.\n- In an impressively unsightly image, Tetlock described the very best forecasters as **foxes with dragonfly eyes**. Dragonfly eyes are composed of tens of thousands of lenses, each with a different perspective, which are then synthesized in the dragonfly’s brain.\n- Foxes see complexity in what others mistake for simple cause and effect. They understand that **most cause-and-effect relationships are [[C_Probabilistic vs deterministic|probabilistic, not deterministic]]**. There are unknowns, and luck, and even when history apparently repeats, it does not do so precisely. They recognize that they are operating in the very definition of a wicked learning environment, where it can be very hard to learn, from either wins or losses.\n- In **wicked domains that lack automatic feedback, experience alone does not improve performance**. ==Effective habits of mind== are more important, and they can be developed.\n#### 11: Learning to drop your familiar tools \n- There are ==no tools that cannot be dropped, reimagined, or repurposed== in order to navigate an unfamiliar challenge. Even the most sacred tools. Even the tools so taken for granted they become invisible.\n\n#### 12: Deliberate amateurs\n- ==Deliberately make time to read something outside your domain frequently. Hyperspecialisation is a well-meaning drive for efficiency, but inefficiency needs cultivating too, and can pay off==\n- “Do we really need to go through courses with very specialized knowledge that often provides a huge amount of stuff that is very detailed, very specialized, very arcane, and will be totally forgotten in a couple of weeks? Especially now, when all the information is on your phone. **You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning**.”\n- an official with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission learned I was writing about specialization and contacted me to make sure I knew that specialization had played a critical role in the 2008 global financial crisis. “Insurance regulators regulated insurance, bank regulators regulated banks, securities regulators regulated securities, and consumer regulators regulated consumers,” the official told me. **“But the provision of credit goes across all those markets. So we specialized products, we specialized regulation, and the question is, ‘Who looks across those markets?’ The specialized approach to regulation missed ==systemic issues.==”**\n- The interface between specialties, and between creators with disparate backgrounds, has been studied, and it is worth defending.\n- work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then **more likely in the long run to be a smash hit** in the library of human knowledge.\n - “I always advise my people to ==**read outside your field, everyday something**==. And most people say, ‘Well, I don’t have time to read outside my field.’ I say, ‘No, you do have time, it’s far more important.’ ==Your world becomes a bigger world, and maybe there’s a moment in which you make connections.”==\n- **At its core, all hyperspecialization is a well-meaning drive for efficiency**—the most efficient way to develop a sports skill, assemble a product, learn to play an instrument, or work on a new technology. But **inefficiency needs cultivating too**. The wisdom of a Polgar-like method of laser-focused, efficient development is limited to narrowly constructed, kind learning environments.\n\n#### CONCLUSION: Expanding your range\n- ==Wicked problems: you must tolerate the highest highs and the lowest lows. Learn and adjust as you go, and even abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely if needed. There is nothing inherently wrong with specialisation, but mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated==\n- “Baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four.” In the wider world, “every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.” It doesn’t mean breakthrough creation is luck, although that helps, but rather that it is hard and inconsistent. **Going where no one has is a wicked problem. There is no well-defined formula or perfect system of feedback to follow. It’s like the stock market that way; if you want the sky highs, you have to tolerate a lot of lows.**\n- Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to **learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely** should the need arise.\n- Finally, remember that **there is nothing inherently wrong with specialization**. We all specialize to one degree or another, at some point or other. My initial spark of interest in this topic came from reading viral articles and watching conference keynotes that offered early hyperspecialization as some sort of life hack, a prescription that will save you the wasted time of diverse experience and experimentation. I hope I have added ideas to that discussion, because research in myriad areas suggests that ==mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated==. As Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a century ago, of the free exchange of ideas, “It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.”\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_So-Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You":{"title":"B_So Good They Can't Ignore You","content":"[Books](notes/Books.md)\nLinks: [[0004 Career]] [[0003 Personal development]] [[BK_So Good They Can't Ignore You]]\nFinished summary 2022.08.22 \n\n## Highlights\n##### [[C_Craftsman mindset vs passion mindset]]\nDifferent approaches to thinking about work: the **craftsman** mindset, a focus on what **value *you’re* producing** in your job, and the **passion** mindset, a focus on what **value *your* job offers you**. Most people adopt the passion mindset, but I argue that the craftsman mindset is the **foundation for creating work you love.**\n\n##### [[C_Deliberate practice]] \nIn most types of work—that is, work that doesn’t have a clear training philosophy—most people are stuck. This generates an exciting implication. Let’s assume you’re a knowledge worker, which is a field without a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate **deliberate practice** into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better. That is, **deliberate practice** might provide the key to quickly becoming **so good they can’t ignore you**. To successfully adopt the [[C_Craftsman mindset vs passion mindset|craftsman mindset]], therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a dedication to **deliberate practice**. #important  \n\n##### [[2_Time management]], [[C_Deep Work]]\nWhen you look at Mike’s spreadsheet, you also notice that he **restricts the hours** dedicated to **required tasks that don’t ultimately make him better at what he does (eighteen hours)** *(i.e. admin tasks)*. The majority of his week is instead focused on what matters: raising money, vetting investments, and helping his fund’s companies (twenty-seven hours). Without this careful tracking, this ratio would be much different.\n\n---\n- A common thread: *the importance of ability*. The things that make a job great are rare and valuable. If you want them, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. *You must be good at something before you can expect a good job.*\n- 2022.08.21 The issue is not choosing the wrong job but *doing the wrong things once you have the job*\n- Ask how you are going to be useful - what can you do for your team, rather than what the team / company can do for you\n## Rule #1: Don't follow your passion \n- It takes time to get good at anything. Don't 'judge all things in the abstract before you do them'\n- There are many complex reasons for workplace satisfaction, but the reductive notion of matching your job to a pre-existing passion is not among them \n- The type of work alone does not necessarily predict how much people enjoy it \n- The happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but those who have been around *long enough to become good at what they do*. This contradicts the passion hypothesis which emphasises the immediate happiness that comes from matching your job to a true passion \n- *Passion is a side effect of mastery*. \n- The following rules show **how people really end up loving what they do** \n\n## Rule #2: Be so good they can't ignore you \n##### TLDR\n2022.07.21 - finished summary of Rule #2\n- Nobody owes you a good job. Don't worry about whether the job is 'just right'. Don't follow your passion, instead become a *craftsman*. This helps you accrue *rare and valuable skills, i.e. career capital*. \n\t- You may not need elaborate plans for your career, just grab the opportunities and accrue as much career capital as possible\n- To get this career capital, you need ***deliberate practice*** to (i) deliberately stretch abilities beyond comfort level and (ii) receive ruthless feedback on performance \n- Thoughts 2022.07.21: \n\t- comforting to know that it's not the exact career you have, but what you make of it. And, *stop thinking what the job can do for you, but what you can do for the job / how to be useful*. And don't need to plan so closely what you want to be in your career, just focus on accruing the capital and the skills (with the documentation / intentionality...) and you will eventually get somewhere, with *patience* too. \n\t- **Deliberate practice** - on paper sounds like a good idea, and can implement the time tracking (toggl) to be more *intentional* with time. But beyond that, the concepts of 'stretching abilities' and 'feedback' are quite fuzzy and may not be so easy to implement in a real work setting? \n\n##### Intro \n- Different approaches to thinking about work: the **craftsman** mindset, a focus on what **value *you’re* producing** in your job, and the **passion** mindset, a focus on what **value *your* job offers you**. Most people adopt the passion mindset, but I argue that the craftsman mindset is the **foundation for creating work you love.**\n- **Hour tracking strategy**: Newport tracks the hours spent doing deep work on research problem... Turning his attention back to the quality of what he produces\n- What's bad about the **passion mindset** \n\t- Focusing only on what the work offers you makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it, leading to unhappiness \n\t- More importantly, the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are *essentially impossible to confirm*. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to *keep you perpetually unhappy and confused*, which probably explains why Bronson admits, not long into his career-seeker epic What Should I Do With My Life? that “the one feeling everyone in this book has experienced is of missing out on life.”\n\u003e There's something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centred concerns about whether your job is 'just right', and instead put your head down and plug away at *getting really damn good*. **No one owes you a great career, you need to earn it**, and the process won't be easy.\n- Put aside whether your job is your true passion, instead turn your focus toward being so good they can't ignore you.\n- Jordan had a name for the worries about *what his friends are doing with their lives and whether his accomplishments compare favorably*: **“the cloud of external distractions.”** Fighting this cloud is an ongoing battle. Along these lines, Steve Martin was so unsure during his decade-long dedication to improving his routine that he regularly suffered crippling anxiety attacks. \n\t- The source of these performers’ craftsman mindset is not some unquestionable inner passion, but instead something more pragmatic: It’s what works in the entertainment business. As Mark Casstevens put it, “the tape doesn’t lie”: If you’re a guitar player or a comedian, what you produce is basically all that matters. If you spend too much time focusing on whether or not you’ve found your true calling, the question will be rendered moot when you find yourself out of work.\n\t- This is relatable... basically fomo about what other people are doing in other seemingly more interesting industries, earning more than you, etc. \n##### The career capital theory of great work \n- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. \n- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your **career capital**. \n- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a *strategy well suited for acquiring career capital*. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.\n- You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the **craftsman** mindset is focused on achieving exactly that goal. \n- The downside of the **passion** mindset is that it strips away merit. For passion proponents like Slim, launching a freelance career that gives you control, creativity, and impact is easy—it’s just the act of getting started that trips us up. *Career capital theory disagrees. It tells us that great work doesn’t just require great courage, but also skills of great (and real) value*. When Feuer left her advertising career to start a yoga studio, not only did she discard the career capital acquired over many years in the marketing industry, but she transitioned into an unrelated field where she had almost no capital.\n##### THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET \n- The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by **developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable**.\n\t- Actuarial: it is a deep and technical field so this is not a concern \n- The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.\n\t- Arguably so, but this is justifiable in any number of ways lol. 'Bullshit Jobs'\n- The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.\n\t- Not currently, but things could change quickly \n\n##### Not having elaborate plans for your career: Mike Jackson\n- He leveraged the craftsman mindset to do whatever he did really well, ensuring that **he came away from each experience with as much career capital as possible**. He **never had elaborate plans for his career**! Just sticking his head up to see who was interested in his newly expanded store of capital, then jumping at whatever opportunity seemed most promising \n- This guy also 'literally tracks every hour of his day down to quarter hour increments' to ensure his attention is focussed on activities that matter → toggl: can track down to the minute, but the thing is it must lead to *actionable insight* - am I actually focussing on the activities that matter after all this tracking? \n##### Chapter 7: Becoming a craftsman: [[C_Deliberate practice]] as the key strategy to acquire career capital, and how to integrate it into working life \n- Central idea of chapter: the difference in strategy that separates average guitar players from the best is not limited to music. This focus on **stretching ability and receiving immediate feedback** provides thee core of a more universal principle - the key to successfully acquiring career capital in almost any field \n- Deliberate practice is **not obvious**: outside fields like chess, music, sports, which have clear competitive structures and training regimes, few do anything remotely close to this. **If you just show up and work hard, you'll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.**\n- Since it's not obvious for knowledge workers how to implement deliberate practice, **if you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life** you have the possibility of 'blowing past your peers in your value' as you're likely alone in your dedication to get systematically better. So this might be the key in becoming so good they can't ignore you. To successfully adopt the *craftsman mindset*, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a **dedication to deliberate practice**.\n- ==**How to implement deliberate practice into a knowledge worker job?**== \n\t- **Stretch your abilities** by *taking on projects beyond your current comfort zone* \n\t- Obsessively seek direct **feedback** on *everything*\n\t- #actionable ==Mike Jackson example==\n\t\t- Mike maintains his dedication to stretching his ability, guided by feedback. His new tool of choice is a **spreadsheet**, which he uses to **track how he spends every hour of every day**. “At the beginning of each week I **figure out how much time I want to spend on different activities**,” he explained. “I then track it so I can see **how close I came to my targets**.” On the sample spreadsheet he sent me, he divides his activities into **two categories**: hard to change (i.e., weekly commitments he can’t avoid - like *admin*) and highly changeable (i.e., *self-directed activities that he controls*).\n\t\t- [[C_Being intentional|intentionality]]: Mike’s goal with his spreadsheet is to **become more “intentional” about how his workday unfolds.** “The easiest thing to do is to show up to work in the morning and just respond to e-mail the whole day,” he explained. “But that is *not the most strategic way to spend your time*.”\n\t\t- When you look at Mike’s spreadsheet, you also notice that he **restricts the hours dedicated to required tasks that don’t ultimately make him better at what he does** (eighteen hours - *admin work in my tracking*). The majority of his week is instead **focused on what matters**: raising money, vetting investments, and helping his fund’s companies (twenty-seven hours). **Without this careful tracking, this ratio would be much different**.\n\t\t- This is a great example of **deliberate practice at work**. “I want to spend time on **what’s important, instead of what’s immediate,**” Mike explained. At the end of every week he **prints his numbers to see how well he achieved this goal, and then uses this feedback to guide himself in the week ahead**. The fact that he’s been promoted three times in less than three years underscores the effectiveness of this deliberate approach. → maybe I should be even more neurotic about my toggl time tracking?? \n\n##### The 5 habits of a craftsman \n- Step 1: Decide the type of career capital market you're in: winner-takes-all vs auction. I'm definitely in an auction market. A collection of relevant skills that combined will give you career capital (many things matter and combine into a whole, instead of a winner-takes-all market like sports / entertainment where you need to be super good at just one thing, e.g. writing TV scripts)\n\t- In an auction market, you may not know exactly what you want to do, but you can set out to gain any capital relevant to this broad topic \n- Step 2: Identify your capital type \n\t- A useful heuristic: seek *open gates* - opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. Easier to start from where you are than from scratch... That seems commonsense enough \n- Step 3: Define 'Good'\n\t- **You need clear goals** - if not it's hard to take effective action \n- Step 4: Stretch and destroy \n\t- Deliberate practice is to push you past the plateau and into a realm with little competition. There is little competition because *it is often the opposite of enjoyable*.\n\t- If you're not uncomfortable, you're probably stuck at an 'acceptable' level. \n\t- **Feedback**: the other half of the deliberate-practice story (other than pushing past what's comfortable). Honest feedback, *even if it destroys what you thought was good*.\n- Step 5: Be patient \n\t- Without the patient willingness to *reject shiny new pursuits*, you will derail your efforts before you acquire the career capital you need. \n\t- Just stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and realising, 'Hey, I've become pretty good, and people are starting to notice'\n\n## Rule #3 Turn down a promotion \n##### TLDR\n2022.07.26 - finished summary of Rule #3. *More details (in the book's words): see below Summary of Rule #3. This is just my summary*\n- Control is the 'dream job elixir', and the best place to invest the career capital acquired (Rule #2). \n- There are 2 control traps (pursuing too much control too early on, hard to pursue control later on when people demand your time). \n- The law of financial viability is an indicator on whether it's the right time to exercise the option for more control (solution to the control traps)\n- Thoughts 2022.07.26 \n\t- I have not reached the point where I want more control in my career yet, or am looking to open a cafe on a whim for more control. So this chapter is not so relatable \n\t- Was a bit confused by the 'law of financial viability'. But seems like this doesn't go against the exhortations to care less about money (e.g. [[B_Mastery]]) or be less materialistic. This is just an indication on *whether it's the right time to get more control*\n\n##### Chapter 8: The dream-job elixir (control)\n- ***Control** over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work you love* \n\t- Control is one of the most universally important traits you can acquire with career capital - something so powerful and essential to the quest for work you love - the dream-job elixir\n- You have to get good before you expect good work \n- Control is scientifically proven to be one of the most important in pursuing a happier, more successful, more meaningful life \n- 'Results only work environment' (ROWE): all that matters is results, not when you work / take leave / reply emails. Leading to employees liberated by control.\n\t- My real world experience in MR SS: still expected to show up and be online for impression management, so not so easy... \n- Summary: if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to *acquire career capital*. Next, *invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control* is one of the most important targets to choose for this investment of capital. \n##### Chapter 9: The first control trap \n- Dangerous to pursue more control before you have career capital to offer in exchange. Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable \n- This may not be so relatable for me because I'm not looking to quit my job to do something unconventional \n##### Chapter 10: The second control trap \n- Once you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, you have become valuable enough to your employer that they will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy \n- Some story about a freelance programmer enjoying control in her life... That's a bit out of touch and not realistic either \n- The *irony of control*: when nobody cares what you do with your working life, you probably don't have enough career capital to do anything interesting. But once you do have this capital, you've become valuable enough that your employer will resist your efforts. \n- The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change \n- Getting the dream job elixir (control): knowing when to do it is difficult because of the 2 control traps (both scenarios feel the same)\n\t- Possible that you don't have enough career capital to back up this bid for more control (first control trap) → then you shouldn't pursue more courage now\n\t- Possible that you have plenty of career capital, and the resistance is exactly because you're so valuable (second control trap) → can pursue the idea \n\n##### Chapter 11: Avoiding the control traps \n- **The law of financial viability**: When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more **control** into your work life, seek evidence of **whether people are willing to pay for it**. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.\n\t- Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable. But this is **different from pursuing money for the sake of having money**. \n\t- 2022.07.26: I'm trying to square this idea with my goal of being less materialistic. So ultimately, money is like 'good grades', and earning more means you are more valuable? \n\t\t- I think this argument is more for people who are trying to introduce more **control** in their lives, since that is the subject of his earlier chapters - that control is the best thing you can buy with career capital. It's not about earning more to impress people / prove that you're worth it / etc. It's that it is an *indicator of whether you can afford to buy more control*\n##### Summary of Rule #3\n- Rule #1 dismissed the passion hypothesis, which was replaced with career capital theory in Rule #2: the traits that define great work are rare and valuable, and if you want these in your working life, you must first build up rare and valuable skills (career capital) to offer in return. How to obtain it: through deliberate practice (beyond comfort level + feedback)\n- Rule #3: how to *invest* the career capital. Best to invest it in *control* (what you do / how you do it), the 'dream job elixir' as many who love what they do have a lot of it.\n- 2 control traps: i) gaining more control without capital to back it up, ii) employers who fight to keep you on a more traditional path when you have more capital. Hard to distinguish one from another\n- one way to distinguish: 'law of financial viability': unless people are willing to pay you, it's not an idea you're ready to go after \n\n## Rule #4 Think small, act big \n##### Chapter 12: The meaningful life of Pardis Sabeti\n- *A unifying mission to your working life can be a source of great satisfaction*\n- Pardis is some researcher who enjoys her job and has hobbies beyond her job. Her happiness comes from the fact that she built her career on a clear and compelling mission: something that not only gives meaning to her work but provides the energy needed to embrace life beyond the lab \n- **The power of mission**: to have a *mission* is to have a unifying focus for your career. It provides an answer to the question *What should I do with my life?*\n\t- Missions are powerful because they focus your energy toward a useful goal, which then maximises your *impact* on your world - a crucial factor in loving what you do \n\t- People who feel that their careers truly *matter* are more satisfied with their working lives, and can *work harder*\n- *How to make mission a reality in your working life?*\n\t- First need career capital (like control). But that's not sufficient. Read the following chapters. \n\n##### Chapter 13: Missions require capital \n- *A mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable*\n- Big ideas are almost always discovered in the '*adjacent possible*', the adjacent space that contains possible *new combinations* of existing ideas. \n- **The capital-driven mission**\n\t- A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough: an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field. So to identify a mission for your working life, you must *first get to the cutting edge*, the only place where these missions become visible \n\t- *First master a promising niche* (could take *years*), then turn your attention to seeking a mission. \n\t- If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace. But it's rare, because such breakthroughs require you to first get to the cutting edge - which is hard and could take years \n\t- *Career capital and getting to the cutting edge*: the process of getting to the cutting edge builds up rare and valuable skills (and career capital). Then identifying a compelling missions once you get to the cutting edge (another desirable trait for career) is like *investing* your career capital. So if you want a mission, you need career capital first. \n- **Summary**: Rule #4 is entitled “Think Small, Act Big.” It’s in this understanding of career capital and its role in mission that we get our explanation for this title. \n\t- *Advancing to the cutting edge* in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to *focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time*. (to acquire career capital)\n\t- Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and *discover a mission in the adjacent possible*, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action.\n- **Thoughts 2022.07.29**: may not be so applicable with my few years of experience, but good to keep in mind going forward: focus first, then dream about the big mission. The adjacent possible idea: finding a niche... I'm already in a niche, but this niche has many parts, and I could find a niche in the niche, which is what I'm slowly doing no ('promising niche'?)? Is it a rare and valuable skill? I think so, *people need this kind of thinking also beyond fin re*. And in newer (still financial-related) actuarial roles. This is less narrow than trad pricing\n##### Chapter 14: Missions require little bets \n- Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using *small but achievable **projects** (**little bets**) to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.*\n- **Just going in the right general direction**: 'no real vision of how it would prove useful'...\n- A common strategy to successful innovators / companies: “Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance,” he writes, “they make *a methodical series of little bets about what might be a ==good direction==*, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins” [emphasis mine]. This rapid and frequent *feedback*, Sims argues, “allows them to find unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes.”\n- These bets are bite-sized: you try one, it takes a few months at most, either succeeds or fails, but either way you get *important [[C_Feedback]] to guide your next steps*. [[B_The 12 Week Year]]\n- This approach stands in contrast to the idea of choosing a bold plan and making one big bet on its success \n- Conclusion: **small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback**\n\t- Career capital: identify a compelling mission. \n\t- The strategy of little bets: increase chances of succeeding in the mission \n- **Thoughts 2022.08.01**: this is encouraging, and reads better than the [[B_Essentialism#^1f21e9|oversimplification in Essentialism]] that you need a 5 year plan and purpose and his condescension at people who don't have 5 year plans for their careers. And gels well with the concept of quarterly planning ala [[B_The 12 Week Year]]. \n\n##### Chapter 15: Missions require marketing \n- Find projects that satisfy the law of remarkability: the idea must inspire people to remark about it \n- **The law of remarkability**: For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be **remarkable in 2 ways**\n\t- First, it must compel people who encounter it to *remark about it to others*\n\t- Second, it must be launched in a *venue that supports such remarking*\n##### Summary of Rule #4\n- Mission is one of the traits to use your career capital to buy \n- Law of remarkability: the mindset of a marketer \n- Little bets\n\n## Conclusion\n- ==**Rule #1 Don't follow your passion**==\n\t- If you want to love what you do, 'follow your passion' can be bad advice. It's more important to become good at something rare and valuable, then invest the career capital this generates into the type of traits (control and mission) that make a job great \n\t- The Rule #1 mindset saved [the author] from needless fretting about which of these paths forward was my true calling. **If tackled correctly, I was absolutely confident that *either* could yield a career I love.**\n- ==**Rule #2 Be so good they can't ignore you**==\n\t- The things that make great work great are rare and valuable. If you want them in your career, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. In other words, if you’re not putting in the effort to become, as Steve Martin put it, “so good they can’t ignore you,” you’re not likely to end up loving your work—regardless of whether or not you believe it’s your true calling.\n\t- The concept of **deliberate practice**—a method for building skills by ruthlessly stretching yourself beyond where you’re comfortable. As I discovered, musicians, athletes, and chess players, among others, know all about deliberate practice, but **knowledge workers do not**. Most knowledge workers avoid the uncomfortable strain of deliberate practice like the plague, a reality emphasized by the typical cubicle dweller’s obsessive e-mail–checking habit—for what is this behavior if not an escape from work that’s more mentally demanding?\n\t- If you’re not careful to keep pushing forward (**something like me now post-exams**), your improvement can taper off to what the performance scientist Anders Ericsson called an “acceptable level,” where you then remain stuck. The research driving Rule #2 taught me that these plateaus are dangerous because they cut off your supply of career capital and therefore cripple your ability to keep actively shaping your working life. So we need practical strategies in our working lives to **make deliberate practice a regular companion in the daily routine** \n\t- **focusing my attention on a bottom-up understanding of my own field’s most difficult results would be a good first step toward revitalising my career capital stores.** → **Relatable - answer the questions in my Q\u0026A bank, rather than just live each day email to email**\n\t- To combat this resistance, I deployed **two types of structure**. \n\t\t- **Time structure:** “I am going to work on this for one hour,” I would tell myself. “I don’t care if I faint from the effort, or make no progress, for the next hour this is my whole world.” But of course I wouldn’t faint and eventually I would make progress. It took, on average, ten minutes for the waves of resistance to die down. Those ten minutes were always difficult, but knowing that my efforts had a time limit helped ensure that the difficulty was manageable.\n\t\t- **Information structure**: capturing the results of my hard focus **in a useful form**\n\t- **Research bible routine**: once a week, summarise a paper possibly relevant to his research. Includes the strain of **deliberate practice** #actionable \n\t- **Hour-tally routine**: a clearly visible sheet of the total number of hours spent that month in a state of deliberate practice\n\t\t- By having these hour counts **stare him in the face every day**, he is **motivated to find new ways to fit in more deliberate practice** into the schedule. \n\t- **Deliberate practice-inducing tasks are often sidestepped** (in a todo list) as the **ambiguous path to completion + mental strain** makes them an unpopular choice in scheduling decisions \n\t- *Getting better and better at what you do requires the strain of deliberate practice. This is a different way of thinking about work, but once embraced, the changes to career trajectory can be profound*\n- ==**Rule #3 Turn down a promotion**== \n- ==**Rule #4 Think small, act big**==\n\t- True missions require 2 things: career capital + ceaselessly scanning your always-changing view of the adjacent possible in your field, **looking for the next big idea. This requires a dedication to brainstorming and exposure to new ideas** \n\t- Combined, these 2 commitments **describe a lifestyle, not a series of steps** that automatically spit out a mission when completed. This is a **3-level pyramid**\n\t- **Top level: tentative research mission**: rough guideline for the type of work interested in (e.g. actuaries and sustainability)\n\t- **Bottom level: background research**: every week, exposure to something new about the field. Add a summary, in your own words, to the growing **research bible** (rule #2 above) #actionable And I'm already actually doing this? \n\t\t- Carve out one walk each day for **free-form thinking** about the ideas turned up by this background research \n\t- **Middle level: exploratory projects**: little bets\n\t\t- Project small enough to be completed in less than a month \n\t\t- Forces you to create new value (e.g. master a new skill)\n\t\t- Produces a **concrete result you can use to gather concrete feedback**\n\t\t- How to make this #actionable ? Q4 2022 project: paying money for the climate change course 2022.08.22 \n- **==Working right trumps finding the right work==**\n\t- Free yourself from the escapist thoughts of fantasy jobs and instead focus on the tasks you are given and accomplish them well.

[[Time block planning]]: to be effective, you need time in fairly large chunks. Also, **do one thing at a time**\n- **Focus on results/contribution rather than efforts**: it is not about how much you OT, but what you are contributing \n## Impressions\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n- A lot of overlap with other self help, notably time management: most crucial. Block your time. And do one thing at a time\n- A lot of the stuff is higher level management stuff, I am not at that level yet. Probably I will relate to more of this in a few years more in my career? May be a bit abstract at this phase (2021)\n- But at this point, I must remember the importance of time block planning / time management / single tasking (he encourages recording time, which I do religiously but *do not act on further* - perhaps I should see how I can **optimise based on my detailed toggl records**. And it's **not about how many hours you work, but on your work output (*be useful*)**\n- Chapters 6-7 are for higher level decision makers \n## Top 3 quotes\n\u003e **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 2 - Know Thy Time|Time management]]**\n\u003e **The supply of time is totally inelastic**. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it and no marginal utility curve for it. Moreover, time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday’s time is gone forever and will never come back. Time is, therefore, always in exceedingly short supply. **There is no substitute for time.** Yet most of the tasks of the executive require, for minimum effectiveness, **a fairly large quantum of time**. To spend in one stretch less than this minimum is sheer waste. One accomplishes nothing and has to begin all over again.\n\n\u003e **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 3 - What Can I Contribute|Focus on contribution]]**\n\u003e The great majority of executives tend to **focus downward.** They are occupied with **efforts** rather than with **results**. They worry over what the organization and their superiors “owe” them and should do for them. And they are conscious above all of the authority they “should have.” As a result, they render themselves ineffectual.\n\u003e \n\u003e The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But **the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, “top management.”** He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.\n\n\u003e **[[BA_The Effective Executive - 5 - First Things First|Concentration: single tasking]]**\n\u003e If there is any one “secret” of effectiveness, it is **concentration**. Effective executives **do first things first and they do one thing at a time**. This is the “secret” of those people who “do so many things” and apparently so many difficult things. **They do only one at a time. As a result, they need much less time in the end than the rest of us.**\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n[[Effective Executive Foreword - 10 lessons]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - Preface and Intro]] \n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 1 - Effectiveness can be learned]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 2 - Know Thy Time]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 3 - What Can I Contribute]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 4 - Making Strength Productive]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 5 - First Things First]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 6 - The Elements of Decision Making]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - 7 - Effective Decisions]]\n[[BA_The Effective Executive - Conclusion]]\n\n\n##### Finding patterns within the chaos (something like [[2_Mental Models]]. Also like [[B_Principles]])\nAccept. Reject. Reply. Ignore. Invest. Harvest. Hire. It can feel like chaos, but the **most effective people find the patterns within the chaos**. In Drucker’s view, ***we rarely face truly unique, one-off decisions***. And there is an **overhead cost to any good decision**: It requires argument and debate, time for reflection and concentration, and energy expended to ensure superb execution. So, given this overhead cost, it’s **far better to zoom out and make *a few big generic decisions that can apply to a large number of specific situations*, to find a ==pattern== within—in short, to go from chaos to concept.**\n# Action plan\nThe **action plan** needs to create a system for **checking the results against the expectations**. Effective executives usually build two such checks into their action plans. The first check comes halfway through the plan’s time period; for example, at nine months. The second occurs at the end, before the next action plan is drawn up. \n\nFinally, **the action plan has to become the basis for the executive’s time management**. ***[[C_Time is an executive’s scarcest and most precious resource]]***. And organizations—whether government agencies, businesses, or nonprofits—are *inherently time wasters*. **The action plan will prove useless unless it’s allowed to determine how the executive spends his or her time**.","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/B_The-Personal-MBA":{"title":"The Personal MBA","content":"[Books](notes/Books.md)\nDate summarised: WIP\n## The book in 3 sentences\n## Impressions\n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n\n- 2022.09.10 A long rail against MBA programmes\n\t- They are not worth the money or the prestige, and the net ROI is perhaps negative / you take very long to recoup the costs. If that is true, then it is encouraging. The message perhaps is that **there is no silver bullet in life**. In the end, you need the real skills to show it, not just the networks / connections / brand name school. \n\t- But it is easy to see the allure of trying to get a prestige MBA. The equation is complex and this is just the *against* points of getting an MBA (non-prestige MBAs are likely non-starters, prestige MBAs may add more value but this is also not a choice I have anyway - see next point)\n\t- If you can get into a top MBA programme, *then you very well can succeed without it*. Perhaps the best reason why it is not worth it. Trying is a waste of time. If I fail, then I don’t get it. If I get in, I still can succeed without it. So both ways no need to go for an MBA.

It helps **offset the temptation to seek novelty always and constantly change course**. It invites us to **show up reliably and thoughtfully**, even when things appear to be moving slowly. It encourages us to **take a longer view,** to recognise when it's wise to let situations unfold in their own time (Loc 1147)\n- 'Go slow to go fast'\n- In so many areas of life - both personal and professional - we tend to zoom in and **view the present moment as all-encompassing**. It doesn't help that our **culture** reinforces this with an incessant focus on **speed and overnight progress**. But when we zoom out and realise that so many of the projects in our lives are nine-inning games, the perceived immediacy of whatever it is we are dealing with relaxes (Loc 1161)\n- 2022.09.17 thoughts: Everyone around seems to be getting ahead with their lives, going to interesting places. But perhaps everyone runs his/her own race and there is no need to compare. Just showing up and 'trusting the process', with faith that eventually things would work out, is perhaps more effective than feeling fomo and unsettled by what others are doing.

That's what this book is about. Thinking is enough to make you grow rich. So the book is a lot about the power of your mind / thoughts to help you attain some goals. \n- 2022.09.17 the style of writing similar to books from that era (How to Win Friends and Influence People?)... How to write so elegantly like this? \n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n### 1 - The power of thought\n- Perhaps linked to [[C_Priming]]. If you keep thinking about something, **you are more ready to pounce and see an opportunity** \n- Many of the most successful people: their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them\n- **Our brains become magnetised with the dominating thoughts we hold in our minds**\n\t- Magnetise your mind with intense desire [for riches]... \n- 2022.08.25 An overly simplified message: just think about success and you will get it \n\t- The danger of such books is that if you don't succeed, it becomes your fault... And that's not how it works in the real world. So many circumstances are still beyond your control, despite how desperately you want 'success'.\n\n### 2 - Desire - the starting point of all achievement \n- **6 steps...**\n\t- Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire (be definite, not just 'plenty of money')\n\t- Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire \n\t- Establish a definite date when you intend to possess this money \n\t- Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, begin at once whether you are ready or not to put this plan into action \n\t- Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire \n\t- Read this written statement aloud, twice daily, morning and night. *As you read, see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money* \n- This is not just for the attainment of money but for any goal \n- All who accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of *dreaming, hoping, wishing, desiring and planning* before the acquired money \n- **If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance**\n- Tolerance and an open mind are practical necessities for the dreamer. Those afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Let no one influence you to scorn the dreamer. \n\t- And some survivorship biased listing of successful dreamers (Columbus, Copernicus...)\n- The power of optimism, p31: **openmindedness is essential for belief. Closed midns do not inspire faith, courage or belief**. No more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. \n\t- *So is there no downside to optimism?* It is free to be optimistic, and the mindset is much better than a pessimst one\n\t- Personal application: to have more belief in myself,  one thing I am lacking. The confidence that if I keep doing what I'm doing, I will succeed and 'go far'. The belief that I have 'potential', so stop doubting and overthinking from the detractors, and the distractions from other careers.\n\n### 3 - Faith - visualising and believing in the attainment of desire\n- 2022.09.01 thoughts \n\t- The text is in my opinion hyperbolic but still there are things to learn from it, especially applicable for an overthinker like me. Just have the right positive thoughts, have some faith, and see where that leads. Optimism is free after all (or perhaps not, if it leads to foolish life choices)\n\t- Just a good reminder that you are what you think, and wishy-washy 'faith' and 'emotion' play a big part also\n- How to develop faith \n\t- Making repeated affirmations to your subconscious mind is the only known method of developing the emotion of faith voluntarily \n\t- 'All thoughts which have been emotionalised (given feeling) and mixed with faith begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart'\n\t- More talk about [locus of control](notes/C_Locus%20of%20control.md): people believe they are doomed to poverty and failure because of some some strange force over which they *believe* they have no control \n\t- *'Deceiving' your subconscious mind: there is nothing wrong with that*. Behave as if you were already in possession of the material thing you are demanding. \n\t- One may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. \n- Faith is a state of mind which may be induced by autosuggestion\n\t- Some outrageous statements about faith p49\n\t- It is a well-known fact that one comes, finally, to believe whatever one repeats to oneself, *whether the statement is true or false*. Repeat a lie over and over and it will become true \n\t- Each of us is what we are because of the dominating thoughts we permit to occupy our minds. \n\t- Any idea, plan or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought. So write out a statement of your major purpose ('Definite Chief Aim'), commit it to memory and repeat it - in audible words, day after day - until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind \n\t- Memorise and repeat some positive statements to gain self confidence...\n- Self confidence formula \n\t- Concentrate thoughts for 30 min daily upon the task of thinking of the person you intend to become, creating in your mind a clear mental picture of that person. 30 min??\n\t- Devote 10 min daily to demanding of yourself the development of self-confidence \n\t- Write down a description of 'Definite Chief Aim' in life, and develop self confidence you will attain it\n\t- 'All impulses of thought have a tendency to clothe themselves in their physical equivalent'\n- The poem that was always in my room finds itself in the book, p55 (describing the law of autosuggestion) - so parents were not entirely wrong about this after all these years \n\t- **Life's battles don't always go to the stronger or faster man, but soon or late the one who wins is the one who thinks he can**\n\n\n\n### 4 - Autosuggestion - the medium for influencing the subconscious mind\n[Mindset](notes/C_Mindset.md), [Locus of control](notes/C_Locus%20of%20control.md), [[C_Thinking regulates actions]]\n- **My summary** 2022.08.21\n\t- You have control over your thoughts that you allow into your subconscious, and the thoughts that enter your subconscious are very powerful.\n\t\t- *Autosuggestion is the **agency of control** through which an individual may voluntarily feed the subconscious mind thoughts of a creative nature or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind*\n\t- Have **faith**, even a childlike one (the most powerful of emotions), that this autosuggestion thing would work. Don't wait for a definite plan to let your subconscious mind think you have the money (or whatever)\n\t- Concentrate on your desire until it becomes a burning obsession\n- **2022.08.21 thoughts** In the past this seems like nonsense, but perhaps now I am more appreciating the message that the **thoughts I have really control a big part of what I really experience**. A lot of the game is mental, given my very strong propensity to #overthinking\n\t- There is still quite a bit of nonsense ('Where failure is experienced, it is the individual, not the method, which has failed') but some parts ring truer to me now based on my current life experiences \n\t- Have not read the other chapters of the book as was interested in this one as I realised the negative thought loops in my head. But this book keeps talking about having a fixed dollar target in your mind and to let that seep into your subconscious. The unabashed pursuit of money seems a bit crass and makes me uncomfortable. How can I go to bed each night saying aloud 'I will have $xx million by 20xx' LOL. Is that the sure path to riches? \n- **No thought** (whether negative or positive) **can enter the subconscious mind without the aid of the principle of autosuggestion**\n\t - All sense impressions which are perceived through the 5 senses are stopped by the *conscious* thinking mind, and may either be passed on to the subconscious mind or rejected at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as the outer guard to the approach of the subconscious. \n- You must communicate the object of your desire directly to your subconscious mind in a spirit of absolute **faith**. Your subconscious mind recognises and acts *only upon thoughts that have been well mixed with **emotion or feeling***. Plain, unemotional words do *not* influence the subconscious mind. The words must be well emotionalised with **belief**. \n- You must be able to concentrate upon a given *desire* until that desire becomes a *burning obsession*\n- **Do not wait for a definite plan** through which you can earn the money. Begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, *demanding and expecting* meanwhile that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan. When they arrive, this inspiration may be considered a direct message from Infinite Intelligence. \n- **Faith is the strongest and most productive of the emotions. Have the faith of a child.**\n- Some extreme instructions on reciting the thing you want right before bed and having the faith that it would come true someday (p74)\n- [In caps] *Read the entire chapter aloud once every night, until you become thoroughly convinced that the principle of autosuggestion is sound, that it will accomplish for you all that has been claimed for it*\n\n### 5 - Specialised Knowledge - personal experiences or observations\n- Knowledge will not attract money unless it is organised and intelligently directed through practical *plans of action* to the *definite end* of accumulation of money. Knowledge is only *potential* power\n\t- Contrast with [Optionality](notes/C_Optionality.md): must everything have a purpose?

I’ve met a few of them personally and have always come away impressed — by their goodwill as well as by their insights. What’s more, I must admit I’ve expressed similar sentiments about Bitcoin myself in private, during this latest bubble.\n\t\t- So what’s going on here? What could be blinding our community to fraud on such a scale?\n\t\t- Part of the answer, I believe, is **illiquidity**.\n\t\t- An _illiquid_ market is one you can’t cash out of quickly. The startup ecosystem is _very_ illiquid: it takes years to decades for founders to cash out of the businesses they build. Startup founders — and the VCs who back them — mostly have experience dealing in illiquid markets.\n\t\t- Crooks don’t like illiquid markets. Crooks like being able to cash out fast: the longer they stay in one place, the higher the chance they’ll be caught and arrested, because they are crooks.\n\t\t- Since illiquid markets repel crooks, the illiquid startup ecosystem turns out to be largely (though [not completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos)!) free from crooks. That’s part of what makes it such a pleasure to work in, but it also means that the community has never developed a great collective radar for fraud: it hasn’t needed one.\n\t\t- ==But the startup community has a _fantastic_ collective radar for things that 1) start small; 2) grow fast; 3) challenge the status quo; and 4) are broadly misunderstood. Those are the features of a promising startup! And the community has learned that it’s expensive to miss out on one of those.==\n\t\t- ==Unfortunately, those are also the features of a fraud==. But the startup community doesn’t encounter much fraud, so it tends to discount the possibility — and in crypto, that’s a grave mistake. Unlike startups, crypto is a _highly liquid_ market — exactly the kind that attracts crooks, and crooks like to do fraud. And that means that many things in crypto that look like promising startups, are actually frauds.\n\t\t- But it’s more than that: on top of everything else, crypto _really is_ a promising technology. [There’s value to decentralization](https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/) and censorship resistance; there’s value to trustless enforcement of [contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/); and there’s value to having a Schelling point for a scarce asset. The startup community is, correctly, recognizing that this potential value exists. But without good fraud radar, it has no way to estimate how much of that value is real _today_.\n\t\t- I believe the startup community is about to have its fraud radar recalibrated. That recalibration — and the exorbitant fee the market will charge for it — will be mandatory for anyone who holds a meaningful amount of crypto.\n### Questions to answer \n2022.08.08 \n- The promise of Defi: \n\t- is the current financial system really so broken? Is it just a political argument to fix the current system with this permissionless system? \n\t- 100% transparent and trustless. How to deal with KYC AML? \n2022.07.16\n- *'Algorithmic monetary policy beats the current human-driven monetary policy from the Fed'.* I surely don't know enough about macro economics to make a thoughtful comment, but such promises touted by crypto believers strikes me as a little naive. How can it be so easy to replicate this highly complex thing using algorithms and formulas? If it were so easy, it would have been done without crypto a long time ago. And code can only be as smart as the humans who make it. Surely these developers are geniuses in their own right, but who is to say if they can beat career policy wonks who have done economic policy for decades? How does crypto help facilitate smarter monetary policy? \n- The whole idea of smart contracts / code being law, and how that is superior to our normal law and contracts. e.g. when Celsius collapsed they paid off all the defi loans because they had to go by the code. I still don't completely buy it that this is better, what about more complex case by case situations? Not everything is so simple and black and white is it? If not why do we need lawyers? \n- Decentralisation / libertarianism: is it ultimately just a political ideology argument that all this decentralisation is good? Is decentralisation actually such a good thing - can human systems function when everything is democratised e.g. DAOs - may not be the most efficient way to get things done \n- What does crypto actually want to solve that isn't really working right now in the world?\n- 'Monetary policy' and why everything is wrong with what the Fed is doing etc. It's not like such complex monetary policy issues can be reduced to codified smart contracts right? \n- What do people actually use crypto for right now? The defi aspect is mostly just for farming, staking, LP right? Do people actually use it for 'real world' purposes like take a loan for their house? If not it just seems to be an 'internal' economy and zero sum game kind of thing. \n\n### Concepts\n- [[Staking]], mining \n- [[Defi]] \n- [[Yield farming]]\n- Stablecoins \n- [[Technical analysis]] \n- Bull run \n- What is the underlying value of crypto? \n- [[DEX]]\n- [[TVL]], Market cap \n- [[Blockchain]]\n- [[EVM]]\n- Privacy, data protection - solved by NFTs?\n- ETH as a security \n- [Incentives](notes/2_Incentives.md) \n- [Network effects](notes/C_Network%20effects.md)\n\n### Tokens \n- [[Ethereum]]\n- [[Bitcoin]]\n- [[Terra (LUNA and UST)]]\n- [[NEAR]]\n- [[Solana]]\n- [[Cardano]]\n\n### Others\n[[BlockFi]]\n\n## To check out\nhttps://game.defikingdoms.com/#/\nhttps://www.thetatoken.org\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/top-5-metaverse-coins-10x-in-2022/\nhttps://www.web3.university/getting-started\nhttps://coinmarketcal.com/en/\n\n## To reread\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/crypto-portfolio-breakdown-and-allocation-strategy/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCLWDGYnAzk\u0026t=0s on DYOR\n\nYGG\n\n\nJon advice: \nCrypto compass guy\n@pentosh1 on twitter \nFocus on layer 1 scaling right now \nFantom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjxja5wB1UI\nCosmos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnpUhcuD4KA\nNear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61UszUFwNY\nHarmony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7venc7ogm8\n\nI will also add that Cardano will also be a strong L1 competitor in 2022.

It is extremely hard to stay on top of everything, and you should not expect to. If you try, you’ll spend all day on Twitter and Discord and never get anything done. \n\nThat ends up being a big problem because the more time you’re trying to consume info, the less time you’re building, and you’re much more likely to Make It from building stuff than reading stuff. **There’s very little alpha in public channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord**, so don’t spend all day hoping someone will leak something that makes you rich. It’s more likely that anything they’re sharing is to get you to be their exit liquidity. \n\nBut it is **good to stay up on what’s going on**, so trying to be very deliberate about creating a focused information funnel is extremely useful. I was constantly churning and replacing sources of info until I could arrive at what gave me the most bang for my buck, with a healthy dose of fun mixed in. \n\nIf you want the 80:20, here it is:\n-   Bankless Podcast (weekly roundups mostly)\n-   The [Daily (Ape / Bear)](https://substack.com/redirect/25e172c2-8582-46b8-bc4d-6893f48da528?u=71619930) Telegram channel\n-   This [Twitter list](https://substack.com/redirect/e390a71d-2107-435f-8814-7e21862ded2b?u=71619930)\n\nYou could probably just follow those sources and you’d know 80-90%+ of everything you need to know about what’s going on. There are plenty of other great sources, and I don’t want to seem like I’m criticizing anyone else. But this will get you quite far if you want to minimize the number of things to stay on top of. \n\nAgain, you are very unlikely to get some crazy life-changing alpha from following tons of people on Twitter or joining tons of Telegrams or Discords. Follow a few big sources of highly focused news, and then join a couple of very tight-knit communities where you are sharing stuff with friends, and focus your energy on doing stuff.","lastmodified":"2022-09-17T09:00:28.668407361Z","tags":null},"/notes/Effective-Executive-Foreword-10-lessons":{"title":"Effective Executive Foreword - 10 lessons","content":"[The Effective Executive](notes/B_The%20Effective%20Executive.md)\nBy Jim Collins \n- #1 First, manage thyself\n- #2 Do what you're made for\n- #3 Work how you work best\n- #4 Count your time, and make it count \n\t- Key metric, e.g. number of creative hours logged each day / week \n\t- Do only one thing at a time\n\t- Unbroken blocks for individual think time, and do it regularly [[Time block planning]]\n- #5 Prepare better meetings\n\t- Preparation with a clear purpose in mind (why are we having this meeting?)\n\t- Disciplined follow up \n\t- Those who make the most of meetings frequently substantially spend more time preparing for the meeting than the meeting itself \n- #6 Don't make a 100 decisions when one will do \n\t- [[Warren Buffett]]: \"inactivity can be very intelligent behaviour\"\n- #7 Find your one distinctive impact \n- #8 Stop what you would not start\n\t- If it were a decision today to start something you are already in, would you?

Frank will love this book as it shows the consequence of going too far in on the *influencing* and bending all the (accounting) rules to your will, for the sake of business. \n\n\n## How the book changed me\n*How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book*\n\n## Top 3(+) quotes\n\n---\n## Summary + Notes\n- Many of the high level people got there because they **got things done** - so execution is very important (seems like motherhood statement, but in reality it's quite hard to see things through to completion, so being able to do so is a skill)\n\t- p76 opposite: \"Enron could talk a good game, but they didn't deliver\" (too focused on dealmaking)\n- 2022.06.23: Interesting to see the wheeling and dealing in corporate America, something like Succession. Boardroom battles, takeover bids, cozying up with important people politicians. A whole different world.\n\t- Learning a bit more about the natural gas business, with parallels to the insurance industry.\n- 2022.06.28 p66 ECT was short on cash (their profits were all paper profits anyway), and Enron didn't want to inject more capital as it wanted ECT to be self-funding. It started **securitisation** of loans, \"removes capital and balance sheets as constraints for growth\". How does that actually work? \n\t- 'Cactus' deal: $900m debt promised to gas producers sold to investors, who then sell the gas back to Enron, and Enron would sell to gas producers... Then debt eliminated from Enron's BS, and ECT gets cash (to accelerate growth)?\n- p71 competition between Mark and Skilling because they had similar backgrounds; [[C_The greatest killer of happiness is comparison]]. Not exactly related, but comparisons are more painful when you compare against e.g. your highschool classmates, people (once) similar to you \n- p74 [[C_Greater fool theory]]\n- p76: 'no one felt responsible for managing the projects after they were up and running. They saw their role as getting the deal done' - cautionary tale for our team, the monitoring / valuation aspect is also important, to maintain the IF book going forward  \n- 2022.06.29 p78 **[[2_Incentives|C_Incentives]]** Drove a lot of the destructive behaviour, e.g. the dealmakers were incentivised by the deals rather than the follow-up. \"Fatal flaw\" was thee compensation structure.\n\t- PVCF (similar to VNB!) was the metric. They were paid when the banks lent money, not when the project was executed \n- 2022.07.01 p88: Government backed financing for development projects \n- 2022.07.02 p91: Visionaries vs deep down operators (Lay vs Kinder): \"there are lots of visionaries, but *very few people who can actually run a company*\"\n\t- Kinder was also the only one at the top who *looked skeptically at things*, consistently asking 'are we smoking our own dope? Are we drinking our own whiskey?'\n- [[Growth stocks]]: the only kind of stocks investors wanted to buy in the bull run of 1990s (companies that EPS grow at double digit rates)\n\t- When a growth company doesn't meet the aggressive target, the punishment is usually severe. *On the up it's great, but can spiral equally quickly on the downside* \n- **Earnings volatility**: the way companies normally work, but they're *not rewarded by Wall Street, which values consistency above all else*. \n- p101: Jeff Skilling had little appreciation for how one got things done in the real world; he had little interest in the nuts and bolts of operations (still a management consultant at heart). That's always important... My current role (MR) shows me the detailed technical stuff (the operational considerations in treaties) and also the bigger picture thinking (business concepts and etc)\n- p102: 'Quality of earnings': Wall St started questioning how Enron managed to hit its earnings targets \n- P102: *good on the way up, terrible on the way down* (like [[00_Crypto]]): when investors love a stock, they'll *forgive a lot*, and gloss over potential problems. But once Wall Street goes negative on a stock, the opposite takes place: a remorseless skepticism takes hold as investors search for clues that more bad news is on the way \n\t- Downgrading of Enron stock to 'hold' (Wall street's code for sell)\n- p105 [[Share buyback]]: when a company buys back its own shares, this results in fewer shares outstanding, which improves the (closely watched) earnings per share number\n- p105: Skilling made Enron more like ECT, which meant creating new, modern businesses and de-emphasising old legacy operations like pipelines and natural gas production \n- His next big idea: trading other things, like electric power \n\t- As thee first big entrant in the power-trading business, Enron could *create liquidity* and exploit big early profit margins from a young, inefficient market \n\t- Enron was an outsider to thee power business though \n\t- Big difference between the 2: electricity couldn't be stored unlike natural gas. So electricity prices were highly volatile (far more than natural gas). Volatility increased potential for big profits, and losses \n- p110 Skilling vs Mark: Skilling believed Enron's future lay in his 'asset-light strategy', driven by brainpower, not physical infrastructure. Mark's division was nothing but hard assets\n- P114 *It is hard to think of a more important concept for Enron than managing risk*. \n\t- Figuring out whether a deal was worth doing was nothing if not an exercise in calculating risk: did the returns justify the risk of all the things that could go wrong? \n\t- Skilling knew Wall Street wanted to see a strong system of internal controls and made the Risk Assessment and Control department a centrepiece of management presentations to Wall Street analysts \n\t- On paper, RAC sounded terrific (it did all the things that the RM department does... And gives its recommendation on whether to proceed with the deal)\n\t- 'RAC was a hurdle, speed bump, but not an obstacle. If a deal had overwhelming commercial support, it got done' - very relatable, and ominous... Maybe we should treat Frank and RM questions with more respect \n\t- Person: CRO Rick Buy was a 'pleasant, paunchy man with glasses, a soft spoken sort, uncomfortable with confrontation' - he couldn't stand up to the originators, deal makers. To be CRO must be ok with being the bad guy... Like Frank\n\t- *It is business wisdom that many of a company's best deals are the ones it doesn't do*. But at Enron, the place was defined by dealmaking (sounds like my team?)\n\t- RAC existed to keep analysts happy\n\t- Putting a lot of pressure on the RAC to sign off by submitting deals close to the quarter end (that's probably why Frank says cannot strong-arm him and set these deadlines)\n\t- The CRO felt he was ineffective, but still wanted to stay because of the money and to wait for his stock options to invest... tough decision and explained by [[2_Incentives]] Again \n- A lot of Enron sounded great in theory, but the reality was something else entirely \n- p120: Company culture, and how everything was different and radical - also because it was the dawn of thee internet age, where there was 'complete suspension of healthy skepticism and disbelief, and brand new dot-coms could pose serious threats to big, established companies'. \n- p126: thee company became mostly traders and deal makers, abandoning its original business model. But a company built around trading and dealmaking cannot possibly have steadily increasing returns. \n\t- Goldman Sachs, widely viewed as the *best trading firm in the world*, has a low [[Price earnings ratio]] Never exceeding 20x. It doesn't even attempt to predict its earnings ahead of time; it can't \n- p124: Mostly just accounting tricks to increase the earnings; changing assumptions that are very sensitive (long term pricing curve) and squeezing out profits from these areas (like recognising OVAC very liberally). Valuing their investments much higher than they actually are worth, and using fair value accounting, recognising the profits in the current quarter\n\t- Basically, just kicking the can down the road by deferring problems to the next period to hit their current quarterly earnings target\n- p132: When did Enron cross the line? The scandal grew out of a steady accumulation of habits and values and actions that began years before and finally spiralled out of control \n\t- In the bull market, all companies did these kinds of semi-shady things that Enron did too \n\t- A new ethos in corporate America: *anything not blatantly illegal was therefore okay*.*\n\t\t- Incentives: creative accountants were rewarded; complex financial structures to make their numbers look better (after Enron, 'creative' became a bad word)\n\t\t- Securities that looked like equity on the balance sheet but for tax purposes could be treated like debt\n\t\t- Securitisations exploded: everything turned to securities to sell to the investing public (lotto winnings, proceeds from tobacco lawsuits)\n- p133: Global Finance led by Fastow led them down the path of ruin \n\t- To bridge the gap between reality of the business and the picture they wanted to present to the world\n\t- Off-balance sheet vehicles, complex financing structures and other complicated deals nobody can understand even today \n- p136 Rules vs principles\n\t- Securitisation was so complex and ripe for abuse, so there were hundreds of rules. Fastow was 'rules driven' from day one, and did anything possible to accomplish his goals while following the precise letter of the rules, even if it meant violating their intent\n\t- He did not cross the line at Continental Bank because they were more risk averse, but at Enron\n\t- Maybe shows the importance of rules based vs principle-based, and why principle-based is probably better...\n- p138 Fastow's unhappiness despite earning so much and climbing so fast: [[C_The greatest killer of happiness is comparison]] - seeing how he will match the top earner salaries\n\t- The finance department didn't have its own P\u0026L (*P\u0026L: meaning the division is more than a cost centre, it makes money for the company*). So he lobbied to have his own division \n- p140: fear culture: people started to get fearful to speak out against Fastow with his volatile temper \n- p140: Fastow was the wrong person to be CFO (at 36 years old)\n\t- He didn't have the knowledge base, his *skillset was narrow* - creating financial structures. He lacked the experience and judicious temperament the job required, the willingness to say no to deals, and attention to basics necessary to insure that the company's balance sheet remained strong. No risk control bone in his body\n\t- He didn't have the basic knowledge, hardly any accounting. A corporate finance asset-backed guy made CFO, doesn't make sense \n- P 142 'Absolute conviction at Enron that clever accounting could alter the business reality'\n\t- 'Rules creating opportunities to exploit weakness'. Form over substance \n\t- They were actually proud of their rule-bending and gaming the system. *In their view, they were doing what every other company was doing, but better and smarter, because they were Enron, where everything was done better and smarter. But while they were smart about bending the rules, they were not smart at all about understanding where all that bending was taking them.*\n- p143 the accountants (AA) had great difficulty saying no to Enron (conflict of interest), one of their biggest clients \n\t- They worked so closely with Enron that they came to see the world in the same way as the Enron executives \n\t- This was also part of the *modern bull market: a gradual disintegration of the high standards that accountants once proudly upheld.*\n- p144 AA's consulting arm: consulting became the tail that wagged the dog, corrupting both the accounting profession and AA itself \n\t- Conflict of interest (why EY now has the channel 1, 2 clients...): accountants would persuade clients to use their consulting services too \n\t- AA had 2 cultures: the sleek, self-satisfied, more prestigious consultants vs downtrodden auditors. Eventually, the consulting arm split to become Accenture \n\t- Eventually, AA focused on keeping clients happy, especially the crown jewel clients (incl Enron) - back to incentives \n\t- The partner lost his skeptic hat and smoked the dope too, believing that the Enron guys were smart enough; couldn't see what the cumulative result would be \n\t- Probably also the impact of groupthink\n- p149 Structured finance: Enron was an aggressive user of structured finance devices like special purpose entities, securitisations, and off-balance-sheet partnerships\n\t- Starting out as pure, clear, legitimate deals that get messier and messier - like drugs \n\nP151 Chapter 11: Andy Fastow's Secrets\n- Finance 101: only 3 ways to fund a company's growth, all ruled out \n\t- Debt: they didn't want too much, hurt their credit rating \n\t- Existing cashflow: they didn't have much of this \n\t- Equity: Skilling didn't want to tap it often - dilute EPS, may hurt stock price\n- Continued to fund growth through 'miracle of structured finance': raising capital off the balance sheet (*off balance sheet debt backed by Enron stock*)\n\t- Off-balance-sheet vehicles and other complex transactions → make money magically appear without either adding stock or debt. They felt like they were magicians \n\t- Fastow's Global Finance department: 'craft solutions', achieve their goals, balance sheet, ... Sounds like something 'structured solutions' does lol \n\t- Circular logic: Enron stock supporting a pool of debt that was used to buy Enron assets and create cash flow\n- Another tool: Securitisation p157\n\t- Idea of securitisation (e.g. credit card loans): instead of waiting for the CF to trickle in over time in future periods, the owner of the asset (e.g. receivable) estimates the value of future cash flow (PV CF) and sells it to investors for a discount. This 'monetises' the assets and gets it upfront \n\t- *Special purpose entities*: set up by companies specifically to purchase assets being securitised. Original idea behind SPEs was to *isolate risk* by setting up an independent legal entity that owned just 1 asset (e.g. credit card receivables).\n\t\t- But if the companies themselves set up SPEs, what's considered 'independence'? There was the rule (something like 'Risk transfer' test...): as long as 3% of capital came from independent source and truly at risk, can classify SPE as independent\n\t- Essentially, Enron borrowed from the future until there was nothing left to borrow. And it was just all 'smoke and mirrors'; they get money that gives them *cash flow* but this doesn't show up as debt (and so equity analysts don't see it)\n- p161: Enron's stakeholder management: they needed help from accountants, lawyers, credit rating agencies, banks, investment banks to carry out their machinations and all the off-balance sheet debt. \n- p162: The banks\n\t- Lending, though the most fundamental of banking activities, had devolved into a low-profit, low-margin enterprise, while investment banking, with outsized *fees*, was one of the most profitable endeavours ever. Enron, with their complex deals and keenness to close them fast, were one of the banks' most profitable customers
