The surprising power of atomic habits \n- **Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement**. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\n- **Habits are a double-edged sword**. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\n- **Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a *critical threshold*.** The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\n- **An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system**. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\n#### Why small habits make a big difference: 1% better compounded\n- We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: **changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years**. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, **the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits**. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.\n - *Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight.* I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a **gradual evolution**, **a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs**. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.\n - The backbone of this book is my **four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward**—and the **four laws of behavior change** that evolve out of these steps. \n - It is so **easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis**. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\n - ==Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement==. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\n- ==A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination==. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems **insignificant in the moment**, but **over the span of moments** that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. **Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations**.\n- It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. **What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success**. You should be far more concerned with your current **trajectory** than with your current **results**. \n- ==Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits==\n\t- Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\n- If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is **follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line**. \n\t- Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.\n- ==Time magnifies the margin between success and failure==. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\n- **Habits are a double-edged sword**. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\n#### The plateau of latent potential \n- ==Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change==. \n\t- This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\n- Similarly, **habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance**. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a **Valley of Disappointment**. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a **hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.**\n- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the **==Plateau of Latent Potential==**. *Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.*\n- **When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success**. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—*when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress*—that makes the jump today possible.\n![[Pasted image 20210517130642.png|500]]\n#### Forget about goals, focus on [[systems]] instead \n- Results have very little to do with the goals you set, and nearly everything to do with the **systems** you follow \n- Goals are the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the **processes** that lead to those results. \n- Goals are good for setting a **direction**, but systems are best for **making progress**\n- Problems with thinking too much about goals and not enough time **designing your systems**\n\t- ==Winners and losers have the same goals==\n\t- Achieving a goal is only a **momentary change**\n\t- Goals **restrict your happiness**\n\t\t- The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that **you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.** For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. \n\t\t- Furthermore, goals create an **“either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment**. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. **It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success**. \n\t\t- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you **don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running**. And **a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.**\n\t- Goals are **at odds with long term progress**\n\t\t- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. \n#### A system of atomic habits \n- Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don't want to change, but because you have the **wrong system** for change \n- ==You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems==\n- Meaning of the phrase **atomic habits**—a regular practice or routine that is **not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power**; a component of the system of **compound growth**.\n\n\n### 2. How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)\n- **There are three levels of change**: outcome change, process change, and identity change.\n- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on **who you wish to become.**\n- **Your identity emerges out of your habits**. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\n- **Becoming the best version of yourself** requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\n- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can **change your beliefs about yourself.**\n#### Three layers of behavior change \n- The 3 levels\n\t- Changing your outcomes: like changing your results - losing weight, etc. Most goals associated with this level of change \n\t- Changing your process: changing your habits and systems - implementing new gym routine, developing meditation practice. Most habits associated with this level \n\t- Changing your identity: changing your beliefs - your worldview, self image, judgments about yourself and others. Most beliefs, assumptions and biases associated with this level \n- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is **when a habit becomes part of your identity.** It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.\n- **True behavior change is identity change.** You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. *Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.*\n\t- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\n\t- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\n\t- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.\n- On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. **Over the long run**, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that **your self-image gets in the way**. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity**.\n#### The two-step process to changing your identity \n- Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.”\n- **Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become**. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the **paradox of making small improvements**.\n\t- In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.\n- ==A simple two-step process to change your identity==\n\t1. Decide the type of person you want to be \n\t2. Prove it to yourself with small wins \n- **The formation of all habits is a feedback loop**, but it’s important to ==let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results==. The focus should always be on becoming that *type of person*, not getting a *particular outcome*.\n#### The real reason why habits matter \n- Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but **fundamentally they are not about *having something*.** They are about ***becoming someone***.\n- Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you **become the type of person you wish to be**. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.\n\n### 3. How to build better habits in 4 simple steps \n- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.\n- The **ultimate purpose of habits** is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.\n- Any habit can be broken down into a **feedback loop that involves four steps**: cue, craving, response, and reward.\n- **The Four Laws of Behavior Change** are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\n#### Why your brain builds habits \n- Habits are **mental shortcuts learned from experience**. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.\n- Habit formation is incredibly useful because ==the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain==. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.\n#### The science of how habits work: the habit loop \n- 4 steps: Cue, Craving, Response, Reward\n- 1\\. Cue: You are answering emails. 2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control. Solution phase 3. Response: You bite your nails. 4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.\n- **If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit**. \n\t- Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.\n\t- Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.\n\t- Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it.\n\t- And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. \n\t- Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\n- All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.\n#### The 4 laws of behavior change \n- **The Four Laws of Behavior Change** provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\n- ==Creating a good habit==\n\t- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\n\t- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. \n\t- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. \n\t- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\n- ==Breaking a bad habit==\n\t- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. \n\t- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. \n\t- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. \n\t- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\n\n## The 1st Law: Make it Obvious\n### 4. The man who didn't look right \n- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.\n- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.\n- The process of behavior change always starts with **awareness**. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\n- **==Pointing-and-Calling== raises your level of awareness** from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.\n- The **==Habits Scorecard==** is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.\n#### The habits scorecard\n- If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” \n- Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.\n- **Habits scorecard**: Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex: the labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. **There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems**. \n\t- All habits serve you in some way —even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise, categorize your habits by **how they will benefit you in the long run**. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.\n\t- “**Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?** Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad\n\n### 5. The best way to start a new habit: Implementation intentions, habit stacking\n- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is **make it obvious.**\n- The two most common cues are ==**time** and **location**.==\n- Creating an **implementation intention** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.\n\t- The implementation intention formula is: **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**\n- **Habit stacking** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.\n\t- The habit stacking formula is: **After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].**\n#### Implementation intentions \n- a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit\n- the format for creating an implementation intention is: **“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”**\n- Or, **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**\n\n#### Habit stacking: a simple plan to overhaul your habits\n- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a *current habit* you already do each day and then *stack* your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\n- Habit stacking is a special form of an **implementation intention**. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a **current habit**\n- The habit stacking formula is: **“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**\n- The key is to tie your desired behavior into *something you already do each day*. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the *natural momentum* that comes from one behavior leading into the next\n- The secret to creating a successful habit stack is **selecting the right cue** to kick things off.\n- Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. **The specificity is important**\n- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to **make it obvious**. Strategies like **implementation intentions** and **habit stacking** are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.\n\n### 6. Motivation is overrated; *environment* often matters more \n- Small changes in **context** can lead to large changes in behavior over time.\n- Every habit is initiated by a **cue**. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.\n- Make the cues of good habits **obvious** in your environment.\n- Gradually, your habits become **associated** not with a single trigger but with the **entire context** surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.\n- It is easier to build new habits in a **new environment** because you are not fighting against old cues.\n#### How to design your environment for success \n- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.\n- The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is **vision**. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that **half of the brain’s resources are used on vision**. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that **visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior**. For this reason, a ==small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do==. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\n- This also means you don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\n- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the **==cue==** a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have **multiple cues**\n-  By **sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings**, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day\n-  Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because **we rarely do it**. *Most people live in a world others have created for them*. But you can **alter the spaces** where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to **take back control** and become the architect of your life. Be the **==designer==** of your world and not merely the consumer of it.\n\n#### The context is the cue \n- The cues that trigger a habit can start out **very specific**, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the **entire context** surrounding the behavior.\n- It is easier to associate a **new habit** with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.\n- Whenever possible, **avoid mixing the context of one habit with another**. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits— and the **easier ones will usually win out**. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.\n- A **stable environment** where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\n### 7. The secret to *self control* (against bad habits)\n- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is **make it invisible**.\n- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\n- People with high self-control tend to **spend less time in tempting situations**. ==It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.==\n- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to **reduce exposure to the cue** that causes it.\n- **Self-control is a short-term strategy**, not a long-term one.\n#### Making it invisible \n- When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals **aren’t all that different from those who are struggling**. Instead, “disciplined” people are **better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control**. In other words, they **==spend less time in tempting situations==.**\n- The **people with the best self-control** are typically the ones who **need to use it the least**. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is **not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a ==more disciplined environment==**.\n- **Bad habits are autocatalytic:** the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a **downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits**.\n-  **==“Cue-induced wanting”:==** an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. **Once you notice something, you begin to want it**.\n- ==**Simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy**==. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the **short-run**, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the **long-run**, **we become a product of the environment that we live in**. *To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.*\n- A more reliable approach is to **cut bad habits off at the source**. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to **==reduce exposure to the cue==** that causes it.\n- ==Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one==. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent **optimizing your environment.** This is the secret to self-control. ==Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.==\n\n## The 2nd Law: Make it Attractive\n### 8. How to make a habit irresistible: temptation bundling \n- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is **make it attractive.**\n- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\n- **Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop**. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.\n- It is the ==anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action==. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\n- ==Temptation bundling== is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to **pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.**\n\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.\n#### The dopamine-driven feedback loop \n- Dopamine is released **not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you *anticipate* it**. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, **so does your motivation to act.**\n\t- Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. \n- It is the ==anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action==.\n- Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you **receive** a reward is the **same** system that is activated when you **anticipate** a reward. This is one reason the **anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it**. Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”\n\t- As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. \n![[Pasted image 20210525084929.png|500]]\n\n#### How to use *temptation bundling* to make your habits more attractive\n- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as **Premack’s Principle: “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”** Even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way.\n- You can even **combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy** we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: \n\t- After[CURRENT HABIT], I will[HABIT I NEED]. \n\t- After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\n- Temptation bundling is one way to create a **heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want**. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.\n\n\n\n### 9. The role of family and friends in shaping your habits\n- The **culture** we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\n\t- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.\n- We tend to **imitate the habits of three social groups:** the **close** (family and friends), the **many** (the tribe), and the **powerful** (those with status and prestige).\n- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to **join a culture** where (1) your **desired behavior is the normal behavior** and (2) you **already have something in common** with the group.\n- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\n- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\n\n#### The seductive pull of social norms \n- One of the deepest human desires is to belong. This ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behaviour\n- We **imitate the habits of 3 groups** in particular: the close, the many, the powerful\n- **Imitating the close**\n\t- the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits\n\t- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to **join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior**. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” **Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself**. You’ll rise together.\n\t- In addition, join a culture where **you already have something in common with the group**\n\t- **Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe**. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. **Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit.** We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s **friendship and community** that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.\n- **Imitating the many**\n\t- There is tremendous internal pressure to **comply with the norms of the group**. The **reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth**. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\n\t- When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n- **Imitating the powerful**\n- We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. **Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.**\n\n### 10. How to find and fix the causes of bad habits\n- The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is **make it unattractive.**\n- Every behavior has a **surface level craving** and a **deeper underlying motive**.\n- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\n- The cause of your habits is actually the **prediction** that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.\n- Highlight the **benefits of avoiding a bad habit** to make it **seem unattractive**.\n- Habits are **attractive** when we **associate them with positive feelings** and **unattractive** when we **associate them with negative feelings**. Create a **motivation ritual** by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\n\n#### Where cravings come from \n- A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. \n- Habits are all about **associations**. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. \n- Your brain is continually absorbing **information** and noticing **cues** in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a **simulation** and makes a **prediction** about what to do in the next moment. ==Every action is preceded by a prediction==\n- **Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions**. Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we ==interpret== the events that happen to us, not necessarily the ==objective reality== of the events themselves. \n- the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to **address your fundamental underlying motives**. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a **craving** to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. **Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings,** and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\n#### How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits \n- You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to **associate them with a positive experience.** Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. \n- **Changing just one word**: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\n- The key point is that ==both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose==.\n- Reframing your habits to **highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks** is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and **make a habit seem more attractive**.\n- [[0007 Mindfulness]] ==Meditation==: Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next **distraction** inevitably pops into your mind. You can **transform frustration into delight** when you realize that **each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath**. Distraction is a good thing because *you need distractions to practice meditation.*\n- ==Pregame jitters==. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings **positively**, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can **reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”**\n- \n## The 3rd Law: Make it Easy \n### 11. Walk slowly, but never backward\n- The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is **make it easy**.\n- The most effective form of learning is **practice, not planning**.\n- Focus on **taking action**, not being in motion.\n- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively **more automatic through repetition**.\n- The **amount of time** you have been performing a habit is **not as important** as the ***number of times*** you have performed it.\n#### Getting started, motion vs action \n- It is easy to get **bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change**: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we **never get around to taking action**. As Voltaire once wrote, **“The best is the enemy of the good.”**\n- Motion vs action: Most of us are **experts at avoiding criticism**. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into **motion** rather than taking **action**: you want to **delay failure.**\n- Motion makes you **feel like you’re getting things done**. But really, you’re just *preparing* to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of **procrastination**, you need to change something. ==You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.==\n- If you want to master a habit, the ==key is to start with **repetition**, not perfection==. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: ==you just need to get your reps in.==\n#### How long it actually takes to form a new habit \n- Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that **simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps** you can take to encoding a new habit. **[[C_Active recall]] similar: active practice vs passive learning**, action vs motion \n- One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How **many** does it take to form a new habit?” That is, **how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic?**\n![[Pasted image 20210529090752.png|500]]\n\n### 12. The law of least effort\n- Human behavior follows the **Law of Least Effort**. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\n- Create an **environment** where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.\n- **Reduce the friction** associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.\n- **Increase the friction** associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.\n- **Prime your environment** to make future actions easier.\n#### The law \n- Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, **our real motivation is to be lazy and to do *what is convenient*.** And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.\n- Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the **Law of Least Effort**, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\n- In a sense, ==every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want==. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. **You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.** The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to **make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it**. If you can make your good habits more **convenient**, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\n#### How to achieve more with less effort \n- One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice **environment design**.\n- If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life.\n- Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.\n#### Prime the environment for future use\n- There are many ways to **prime your environment** so it’s ready for immediate use. Simple ways to make the good habit **the path of least resistance**. The inverse is true for bad habits \n- It is remarkable **how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behaviour**\n- **Redesign your life** so the **actions that matter most** are also **the actions that are easiest to do**.\n\n### 13. How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule \n- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but **continue to impact your behavior** for minutes or hours afterward.\n- Many habits occur at **decisive moments**—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.\n- The **Two-Minute Rule** states, “**When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.**”\n- The more you **ritualize the beginning of a process**, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.\n- **Standardize before you optimize.** You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.\n#### Decisive moments\n- Researchers estimate that **40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit**. This is already a substantial percentage, but the **true influence** of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are **automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow**. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also **shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward**.\n- Habits are like the **entrance ramp to a highway**. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be **easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.**\n- ==Every day, there are a handful of **moments** that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as **decisive moments**==. These choices are a fork in the road.\n\t- The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. \n\t- The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. \n\t- The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game controller. \n![[Pasted image 20210531090923.png|500]]\n- We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why **mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important**. ==Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a **few** habitual choices that determine the path you take==. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\n#### The two-minute rule \n- **When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do**\n- The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start \n- What you want is a 'gateway habit' that naturally leads you down a more productive path \n- The point is not to do one thing. It is to **master the habit of showing up**\n- The more you **ritualize the beginning of a process**, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.\n- We rarely think about change this way because **everyone is consumed by the end goal**. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\n\n### 14. How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible \n- The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is **make it difficult.**\n- A **commitment device** is a **choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.**\n- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to **automate your habits.**\n- **==Onetime choices==**—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.\n- Using **technology** to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.\n\n#### A commitment device\n- Sometimes success is **less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard**. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: **make it difficult.** \n- If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a **commitment device**: a choice you make in the **present** that controls your actions in the **future**. It is a way to **lock in future behavior**, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.\n- Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to **take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation**.\n- The key is to **change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.** \n\t- If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call.\n\t- When the time comes to act, **the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.**\n- Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll **do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present.**\n\n#### How to automate a habit and never think about it again \n- The best way to break a bad habit is to **make it impractical to do**. Increase the **friction** until you don’t even have the option to act\n- Some actions—like installing a cash register—**pay off again and again**. These ==onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time==. I’m fascinated by the idea that a **single choice** can deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term habits\n- When you automate as much of your life as possible, ==you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.== Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth.\n- **Locking yourself out of social media:** One of the biggest surprises was **how quickly I adapted**. Within the first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. **After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much easier to eat the healthy stuff**.\n\n## The 4th Law: Make it Satisfying \n### 15. The cardinal rule of behavior change \n- The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.\n- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.\n- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.\n- **The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided**.\n- To get a habit to stick you need to **feel immediately successful**— *even* if it’s in a *small way.*\n- The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be **performed this time**. The fourth law of behavior change —make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be **repeated next time**.\n\n#### Making it satisfying\n- We are **more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying**. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—==even minor ones== like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\n- **the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is (immediately) rewarded is repeated. What is (immediately) punished is avoided.** You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.\n- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for **immediate satisfaction**.\n\n#### The mismatch between immediate and delayed rewards (delayed gratification)\n- **The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.** It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment. Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new.\n- Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as **==time inconsistency==**. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time. **You value the present more than the future**. \n\t- Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.\n- Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often **misaligned**. With our **bad** habits, the immediate outcome usually feels **good**, but the ultimate outcome feels **bad**. With **good** habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is **unenjoyable**, but the ultimate outcome feels **good**\n- ==the costs of your **good** habits are in the **present**. The costs of your **bad** habits are in the **future**.==\n- As a general rule, the **more immediate pleasure** you get from an action, the more strongly you should **question** whether it aligns with your long-term goals\n-  Updating the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is **immediately** rewarded is repeated. What is **immediately** punished is avoided.\n-  Our preference for **instant gratification** reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, **most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction**. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. **If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff**. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\n-  **it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification**—but you need to work with the grain of human\nnature, not against it. The best way to do this is to **add a little bit of immediate pleasure** to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\n#### How to turn instant gratification to your advantage \n- The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to **feel successful—even if it’s in a small way**. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.\n- What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the **ending of a behavior**. The **==ending of any experience== is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases**. You want the **ending of your habit to be satisfying**. The best approach is to use **reinforcement**, which refers to the process of using an **immediate reward** to increase the rate of a behavior. \n\t- **Habit stacking**, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to **start**. \n\t- **Reinforcement** ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you **finish**.\n- it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new **identity** to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps **maintain motivation in the short term** while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\n- **Change is easy when it is enjoyable.**\n### 16. How to stick with good habits every day \n- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.\n- A **habit tracker** is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.\n- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.\n- Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.\n- **Never miss twice.** If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.\n- Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.\n\n#### How to keep your habits on track: with a habit tracker \n- Habit tracking is powerful because **it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change**. It simultaneously makes a behavior **obvious**, **attractive**, and **satisfying**.\n- Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re **focused on the process rather than the result**. You’re not fixated on getting six- pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the *type of person* who doesn’t miss workouts.\n- In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides **visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become**, which is a delightful form of **immediate** and **intrinsic** gratification.\n- manual tracking should be limited to your **most important habits.** It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.\n- Record each measurement **immediately after the habit occurs.** The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.\n\t- The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\n#### ==How to quickly recover when your habits break down==\n#important \n- **Never miss twice**. \n- **The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing one is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit**\n- This is a distinguishing feature between **winners and losers**. **Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.** The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\n-  this principle is so important that I’ll **stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like**. Too often, we fall into an **all-or-nothing cycle** with our habits. The **problem** is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, *then you shouldn’t do it at all.*\n-  You don’t realize ==how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days==. **Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you.** If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”\n- This is why the **“bad” workouts are often the most important ones**. Sluggish days and bad workouts **maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days**. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.\n- Furthermore, it’s **not always about *what happens during the workout***. It’s about **being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts**. It’s ==easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope==. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it **reaffirms your identity.**\n#### Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit\n - The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that **we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it**.\n - This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, **we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior**.\n - his is sometimes referred to as **[[C_Goodhart's Law|Goodhart’s Law]]**. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, ==“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”== Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.\n-  it’s crucial to **keep habit tracking in its proper place**. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to something entirely different.\n### 17. How an accountability partner can change everything \n- The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying.\n- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is **painful or unsatisfying.**\n- An accountability partner can create an **immediate cost to inaction**. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.\n- A **habit contract** can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.\n- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.\n#### Adding an immediate cost to a bad habit \n- Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. \n- The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an **instant cost** to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\n- **We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon**. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to ==increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior==. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.\n- We’ll **jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.**\n- A straightforward way to **add an immediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract.**\n\n#### The habit contract\n- To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\n\n## Advanced Tactics\n### 18. The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)\n- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to **choose the right field of competition**.\n- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.\n- **Genes** cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.\n- Habits are easier when they **align with your natural abilities**. Choose the habits that best suit you.\n- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.\n- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.\n#### Choosing the right field of competition \n- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to **choose the right field of competition**. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.\n- The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\n- In short: **genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity**. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to **direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability**.\n- The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding your personality.\n#### How your personality influences your habits \n- Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything.\n- The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the ==“[[Big Five]],”== which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.\n\t1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.\n\t2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easy going and spontaneous.\n\t3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n\t4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.\n\t5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.\n- Build habits that **work for your personality**. You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.\n\n#### How to find a game where the odds are in your favour \n- In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, **any area can become challenging**. At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skillset.\n- The **explore/exploit trade-off**\n- In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent\n- The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. **If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career— it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it**. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.\n- Questions to continually ask \n\t- What feels like fun to me, but work to others? \n\t- What makes me lose track of time? ([[C_Flow]])\n\t- Where do I get greater returns than the average person? \n\t- What comes naturally to me? \n- We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.\n- When you can’t win by being better, you can **win by being different**. By **combining** your skills, you **reduce the level of competition,** which makes it **easier to stand out**. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by **rewriting the rules**. A good player works hard to win the game *everyone else is playing*. A great player ==creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses==.\n- Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you\n\n#### How to get the most out of your genes\n- One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. **Work hard on the things that come easy**.\n\n### 19. The Goldilocks Rule: how to stay motivated in life and work \n- The **Goldilocks Rule** states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are **right on the edge of their current abilities.**\n- The greatest threat to success is not failure but **boredom**.\n- As habits become routine, they become **less interesting and less satisfying**. We get bored.\n- **Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated**. It’s the **ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting** that makes the difference.\n- Professionals **stick to the schedule**; amateurs let life get in the way.\n\n#### The Goldilocks Rule \n- How do we design habits that pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for many years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that **the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “==just manageable difficulty==.”**\n- The human brain loves a challenge, **but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty**. \n- The Goldilocks Rule states that **humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the ==edge of their current abilities==**. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\n- Once a habit **has been established**, it’s important to continue to **advance in small ways**. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a [[C_Flow|flow]] state.\n\n#### How to stay focus when you get bored working on your goals \n- “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”\n- Successful people face the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom\n- Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster than that. Hitting your habit a few times in a row and *letting one day slip doesn't feel like much*. Things are going well. It's *easy to rationalise taking a day off because you're in a good place*. **The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.**\n- \"Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly\"\n- The **sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure**: half of the time you get what you want. One of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you're already interested in a habit, working on challenges of **just manageable difficulty** is a good way to **keep things interesting**\n- Variable rewards or not, **no habit will stay interesting forever**. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self improvement: **you have to fall in love with boredom**\n- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. \n- \"There have been a lot of sets that I haven't felt like finishing, but I've never regretted doing the workout\"\n- The only way to become excellent is to be **endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.**\n\n### 20. The downside of creating good habits \n- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors\n- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery \n- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time\n- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it \n#### The downside\n- Habits are necessary, but not sufficient, for mastery. Need a combination of **automatic habits + deliberate practice**\n- After one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin building the next habit \n- **Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalised the skill, then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development**\n- Each habit unlocks the next level of performance \n#### Mastering one habit \n![[Pasted image 20210611085636.png|500]]\n- It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill - right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable - that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency\n- Solution: establish a system for **reflection and review**\n#### How to review and make adjustments\n- [[Journalling]]: Reflection and review enables the long term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalisations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday. \n- Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review, and the process does not have to be complex\n- Review the day and search for **areas that can be improved**\n- Executives and investors who keep a **decision journal** in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of the month or year to see where they were correct or wrong \n- Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about **fine-tuning them**. Reflection and review ensures you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary \n- Reflection brings a **sense of perspective**: daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away (too much feedback). Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in a mirror from a conversational distance - seeing the important changes without losing sight of the bigger picture\n##### Integrity report \n- 2 primary modes of reflection and review: Annual Review, and **Integrity Report**\n- The Integrity Report helps me realise where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. To revisit core values, consider whether I have been living in accordance with them\n- Three questions\n\t- What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n\t- How am I living and working with integrity right now? \n\t- How can I set a higher standard in the future? \n- These reports **prevent the gradual slide that happens when I don't pay close attention**\n#### How to break the habits that hold you back \n- The more sacred an idea is to us - the more deeply it is tied to our identity - the more strongly we will defend it against criticism \n- Solution: avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are\n- The key to mitigating losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes \n- A lack of self awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote\n\n## Conclusion: The secret to results that last\n- The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, but a thousand of them. A bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system \n- Eventually, if you stick with it, you **hit a tipping point**. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working **for you rather than against you**\n- Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. \n- If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. It is your **system**. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because **you have the wrong system for change**. \n![[Pasted image 20210613094241.png|500]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Books":{"title":"Books","content":"\n\n[Atomic Habits](notes/B_Atomic%20Habits.md)","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/C_Greenwashing":{"title":"Greenwashing","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/C_Tipping-point":{"title":"C_Tipping point","content":"- Change is usually slow, then happens all at once\n- Convexity effects, [[B_Antifragile]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/C_Wicked-environments":{"title":"C_Wicked environments","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Carbon-pricing":{"title":"Carbon pricing","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Climate-change-sustainability":{"title":"Climate change, sustainability","content":"\n## Concepts\n- What is the problem: carbon emissions → higher temperatures → many effects\n- [Carbon pricing](notes/Carbon%20pricing.md)\n- Who foots the bill: wealthy or developing nations?\n\t- how do wealthy nations subsidise the poor ones \n- [C_Tipping point](notes/C_Tipping%20point.md): the change can come all at once, we don't know if we have reached that point yet\n- Delay in results\n\t- releasing carbon into the atmosphere - effects would only be seen in the future\n- Irreversibility of changes \n\t- once done, cannot reverse the damage - carbon released into the atmosphere would have impacts (i.e. even if we stop now, we would still experience the effects)\n- Investing \n\t- long term horizons\n\t- Not pricing it in valuations\n\t- Impairment of assets today (stranded assets) vs in the future when the actual assets are impaired \n\t- [[Stranded assets]]\n- Solutions: \n\t- COP, other international conferences, etc. \n- This is a [wicked problem](notes/C_Wicked%20environments.md).

I’ve met a few of them personally and have always come away impressed — by their goodwill as well as by their insights. What’s more, I must admit I’ve expressed similar sentiments about Bitcoin myself in private, during this latest bubble.\n\t\t- So what’s going on here? What could be blinding our community to fraud on such a scale?\n\t\t- Part of the answer, I believe, is **illiquidity**.\n\t\t- An _illiquid_ market is one you can’t cash out of quickly. The startup ecosystem is _very_ illiquid: it takes years to decades for founders to cash out of the businesses they build. Startup founders — and the VCs who back them — mostly have experience dealing in illiquid markets.\n\t\t- Crooks don’t like illiquid markets. Crooks like being able to cash out fast: the longer they stay in one place, the higher the chance they’ll be caught and arrested, because they are crooks.\n\t\t- Since illiquid markets repel crooks, the illiquid startup ecosystem turns out to be largely (though [not completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos)!) free from crooks. That’s part of what makes it such a pleasure to work in, but it also means that the community has never developed a great collective radar for fraud: it hasn’t needed one.\n\t\t- ==But the startup community has a _fantastic_ collective radar for things that 1) start small; 2) grow fast; 3) challenge the status quo; and 4) are broadly misunderstood. Those are the features of a promising startup! And the community has learned that it’s expensive to miss out on one of those.==\n\t\t- ==Unfortunately, those are also the features of a fraud==. But the startup community doesn’t encounter much fraud, so it tends to discount the possibility — and in crypto, that’s a grave mistake. Unlike startups, crypto is a _highly liquid_ market — exactly the kind that attracts crooks, and crooks like to do fraud. And that means that many things in crypto that look like promising startups, are actually frauds.\n\t\t- But it’s more than that: on top of everything else, crypto _really is_ a promising technology. [There’s value to decentralization](https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/) and censorship resistance; there’s value to trustless enforcement of [contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/); and there’s value to having a Schelling point for a scarce asset. The startup community is, correctly, recognizing that this potential value exists. But without good fraud radar, it has no way to estimate how much of that value is real _today_.\n\t\t- I believe the startup community is about to have its fraud radar recalibrated. That recalibration — and the exorbitant fee the market will charge for it — will be mandatory for anyone who holds a meaningful amount of crypto.\n### Questions to answer \n2022.08.08 \n- The promise of Defi: \n\t- is the current financial system really so broken? Is it just a political argument to fix the current system with this permissionless system? \n\t- 100% transparent and trustless. How to deal with KYC AML? \n2022.07.16\n- The whole idea of smart contracts / code being law, and how that is superior to our normal law and contracts. e.g. when Celsius collapsed they paid off all the defi loans because they had to go by the code. I still don't completely buy it that this is better, what about more complex case by case situations? Not everything is so simple and black and white is it? If not why do we need lawyers? \n- Decentralisation / libertarianism: is it ultimately just a political ideology argument that all this decentralisation is good? Is decentralisation actually such a good thing - can human systems function when everything is democratised e.g. DAOs - may not be the most efficient way to get things done \n- What does crypto actually want to solve that isn't really working right now in the world?\n- 'Monetary policy' and why everything is wrong with what the Fed is doing etc. It's not like such complex monetary policy issues can be reduced to codified smart contracts right? \n- What do people actually use crypto for right now? The defi aspect is mostly just for farming, staking, LP right? Do people actually use it for 'real world' purposes like take a loan for their house? If not it just seems to be an 'internal' economy and zero sum game kind of thing. \n\n\n### Concepts\n- [[Staking]], mining \n- [[Defi]] \n- [[Yield farming]]\n- Stablecoins \n- [[Technical analysis]] \n- Bull run \n- What is the underlying value of crypto? \n- [[DEX]]\n- [[TVL]], Market cap \n- [[Blockchain]]\n- [[EVM]]\n- Privacy, data protection - solved by NFTs?\n- ETH as a security \n\n### Tokens \n- [[Ethereum]]\n- [[Bitcoin]]\n- [[Terra (LUNA and UST)]]\n- [[NEAR]]\n- [[Solana]]\n- [[Cardano]]\n\n### Others\n[[BlockFi]]\n\n## To check out\nhttps://game.defikingdoms.com/#/\nhttps://www.thetatoken.org\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/top-5-metaverse-coins-10x-in-2022/\nhttps://www.web3.university/getting-started\nhttps://coinmarketcal.com/en/\n\n## To reread\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/crypto-portfolio-breakdown-and-allocation-strategy/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCLWDGYnAzk\u0026t=0s on DYOR\n\nYGG\n\n\nJon advice: \nCrypto compass guy\n@pentosh1 on twitter \nFocus on layer 1 scaling right now \nFantom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjxja5wB1UI\nCosmos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnpUhcuD4KA\nNear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61UszUFwNY\nHarmony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7venc7ogm8\n\nI will also add that Cardano will also be a strong L1 competitor in 2022.

It is extremely hard to stay on top of everything, and you should not expect to. If you try, you’ll spend all day on Twitter and Discord and never get anything done. \n\nThat ends up being a big problem because the more time you’re trying to consume info, the less time you’re building, and you’re much more likely to Make It from building stuff than reading stuff. **There’s very little alpha in public channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord**, so don’t spend all day hoping someone will leak something that makes you rich. It’s more likely that anything they’re sharing is to get you to be their exit liquidity. \n\nBut it is **good to stay up on what’s going on**, so trying to be very deliberate about creating a focused information funnel is extremely useful. I was constantly churning and replacing sources of info until I could arrive at what gave me the most bang for my buck, with a healthy dose of fun mixed in. \n\nIf you want the 80:20, here it is:\n-   Bankless Podcast (weekly roundups mostly)\n-   The [Daily (Ape / Bear)](https://substack.com/redirect/25e172c2-8582-46b8-bc4d-6893f48da528?u=71619930) Telegram channel\n-   This [Twitter list](https://substack.com/redirect/e390a71d-2107-435f-8814-7e21862ded2b?u=71619930)\n\nYou could probably just follow those sources and you’d know 80-90%+ of everything you need to know about what’s going on. There are plenty of other great sources, and I don’t want to seem like I’m criticizing anyone else. But this will get you quite far if you want to minimize the number of things to stay on top of. \n\nAgain, you are very unlikely to get some crazy life-changing alpha from following tons of people on Twitter or joining tons of Telegrams or Discords. Follow a few big sources of highly focused news, and then join a couple of very tight-knit communities where you are sharing stuff with friends, and focus your energy on doing stuff.","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T04:28:11.390605225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Mental-model-collection":{"title":"Mental model collection","content":"[Back home](_index.md)\n\n***Everything that begins with C***\nThese are ideas mostly and ways of thinking.
