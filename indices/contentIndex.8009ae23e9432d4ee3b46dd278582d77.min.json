(not for Notion)\n- 2022.08.21 **What goes up must come down**\n\t- Really don't get drawn in by the hype, if ETH surges up, it will come down equally quickly, when will I learn this #lesson? \n\n2022.07.18\n- https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3\n\t- Interesting point on why the smart tech bros may be blind to any crypto 'fraud': they don't have the radar, because the startup industry is very illiquid - and fraudsters work best in liquid markets (which crypto is)\n\t\t- These are well-respected members of the community. I‚Äôve met a few of them personally and have always come away impressed ‚Äî by their goodwill as well as by their insights. What‚Äôs more, I must admit I‚Äôve expressed similar sentiments about Bitcoin myself in private, during this latest bubble.\n\t\t- So what‚Äôs going on here? What could be blinding our community to fraud on such a scale?\n\t\t- Part of the answer, I believe, is **illiquidity**.\n\t\t- An¬†_illiquid_¬†market is one you can‚Äôt cash out of quickly. The startup ecosystem is¬†_very_¬†illiquid: it takes years to decades for founders to cash out of the businesses they build. Startup founders ‚Äî and the VCs who back them ‚Äî mostly have experience dealing in illiquid markets.\n\t\t- Crooks don‚Äôt like illiquid markets. Crooks like being able to cash out fast: the longer they stay in one place, the higher the chance they‚Äôll be caught and arrested, because they are crooks.\n\t\t- Since illiquid markets repel crooks, the illiquid startup ecosystem turns out to be largely (though¬†[not completely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos)!) free from crooks. That‚Äôs part of what makes it such a pleasure to work in, but it also means that the community has never developed a great collective radar for fraud: it hasn‚Äôt needed one.\n\t\t- ==But the startup community has a¬†_fantastic_¬†collective radar for things that 1) start small; 2) grow fast; 3) challenge the status quo; and 4) are broadly misunderstood. Those are the features of a promising startup! And the community has learned that it‚Äôs expensive to miss out on one of those.==\n\t\t- ==Unfortunately, those are also the features of a fraud==. But the startup community doesn‚Äôt encounter much fraud, so it tends to discount the possibility ‚Äî and in crypto, that‚Äôs a grave mistake. Unlike startups, crypto is a¬†_highly liquid_¬†market ‚Äî exactly the kind that attracts crooks, and crooks like to do fraud. And that means that many things in crypto that look like promising startups, are actually frauds.\n\t\t- But it‚Äôs more than that: on top of everything else, crypto¬†_really is_¬†a promising technology.¬†[There‚Äôs value to decentralization](https://stratechery.com/2021/internet-3-0-and-the-beginning-of-tech-history/)¬†and censorship resistance; there‚Äôs value to trustless enforcement of¬†[contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/); and there‚Äôs value to having a Schelling point for a scarce asset. The startup community is, correctly, recognizing that this potential value exists. But without good fraud radar, it has no way to estimate how much of that value is real¬†_today_.\n\t\t- I believe the startup community is about to have its fraud radar recalibrated. That recalibration ‚Äî and the exorbitant fee the market will charge for it ‚Äî will be mandatory for anyone who holds a meaningful amount of crypto.\n### Questions to answer \n2022.08.08 \n- The promise of Defi: \n\t- is the current financial system really so broken? Is it just a political argument to fix the current system with this permissionless system? \n\t- 100% transparent and trustless. How to deal with KYC AML? \n2022.07.16\n- The whole idea of smart contracts / code being law, and how that is superior to our normal law and contracts. e.g. when Celsius collapsed they paid off all the defi loans because they had to go by the code. I still don't completely buy it that this is better, what about more complex case by case situations? Not everything is so simple and black and white is it? If not why do we need lawyers? \n- Decentralisation / libertarianism: is it ultimately just a political ideology argument that all this decentralisation is good? Is decentralisation actually such a good thing - can human systems function when everything is democratised e.g. DAOs - may not be the most efficient way to get things done \n- What does crypto actually want to solve that isn't really working right now in the world?\n- 'Monetary policy' and why everything is wrong with what the Fed is doing etc. It's not like such complex monetary policy issues can be reduced to codified smart contracts right? \n- What do people actually use crypto for right now? The defi aspect is mostly just for farming, staking, LP right? Do people actually use it for 'real world' purposes like take a loan for their house? If not it just seems to be an 'internal' economy and zero sum game kind of thing. \n\n\n### Concepts\n- [[Staking]], mining \n- [[Defi]] \n- [[Yield farming]]\n- Stablecoins \n- [[Technical analysis]] \n- Bull run \n- What is the underlying value of crypto? \n- [[DEX]]\n- [[TVL]], Market cap \n- [[Blockchain]]\n- [[EVM]]\n- Privacy, data protection - solved by NFTs?\n- ETH as a security \n\n### Tokens \n- [[Ethereum]]\n- [[Bitcoin]]\n- [[Terra (LUNA and UST)]]\n- [[NEAR]]\n- [[Solana]]\n- [[Cardano]]\n\n### Others\n[[BlockFi]]\n\n## To check out\nhttps://game.defikingdoms.com/#/\nhttps://www.thetatoken.org\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/top-5-metaverse-coins-10x-in-2022/\nhttps://www.web3.university/getting-started\nhttps://coinmarketcal.com/en/\n\n## To reread\nhttps://chaindebrief.com/crypto-portfolio-breakdown-and-allocation-strategy/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCLWDGYnAzk\u0026t=0s on DYOR\n\nYGG\n\n\nJon advice: \nCrypto compass guy\n@pentosh1 on twitter \nFocus on layer 1 scaling right now \nFantom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjxja5wB1UI\nCosmos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnpUhcuD4KA\nNear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61UszUFwNY\nHarmony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7venc7ogm8\n\nI will also add that Cardano will also be a strong L1 competitor in 2022.

It is extremely hard to stay on top of everything, and you should not expect to. If you try, you‚Äôll spend all day on Twitter and Discord and never get anything done.¬†\n\nThat ends up being a big problem because the more time you‚Äôre trying to consume info, the less time you‚Äôre building, and you‚Äôre much more likely to Make It from building stuff than reading stuff. **There‚Äôs very little alpha in public channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord**, so don‚Äôt spend all day hoping someone will leak something that makes you rich. It‚Äôs more likely that anything they‚Äôre sharing is to get you to be their exit liquidity.¬†\n\nBut it is **good to stay up on what‚Äôs going on**, so trying to be very deliberate about creating a focused information funnel is extremely useful. I was constantly churning and replacing sources of info until I could arrive at what gave me the most bang for my buck, with a healthy dose of fun mixed in.¬†\n\nIf you want the 80:20, here it is:\n-   Bankless Podcast (weekly roundups mostly)\n-   The¬†[Daily (Ape / Bear)](https://substack.com/redirect/25e172c2-8582-46b8-bc4d-6893f48da528?u=71619930)¬†Telegram channel\n-   This¬†[Twitter list](https://substack.com/redirect/e390a71d-2107-435f-8814-7e21862ded2b?u=71619930)\n\nYou could probably just follow those sources and you‚Äôd know 80-90%+ of everything you need to know about what‚Äôs going on. There are plenty of other great sources, and I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm criticizing anyone else.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz?

Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-09-02T15:27:23.554750336Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n\u003e ‚úèÔ∏è Step 2: [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-09-02T15:27:23.554750336Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
