While we accept the domain-specificity of games, we find it hard to apply this lesson to technical skills applied in schools: <em>what is picked up in the classroom stays largely in the classroom</em></li><li><strong>An Antifragile (Barbell) Education</strong>: very relatable, as it talks about good grades isn&rsquo;t so useful outside school<ul><li>Be an &lsquo;autodidact&rsquo;, a person of knowledge compared to students who swallow school material, and knowledge only derived from the curriculum. The edge isn&rsquo;t in the package of the official program of school, which <em>everyone knew with small variations multiplying into large discrepancies in grades</em>, but <em>what exactly lay outside it</em></li><li>Analogy of gym rats vs street gangsters: you can lift heavy weights but fail to lift a stone, and get hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. The gym rat&rsquo;s strength is extremely <em>domain-specific and their domain doesn&rsquo;t exist outside of ludic - extremely organised - constructs</em>.

He keeps a log of his reading hours since age 13 (30-60 / week!) #actionable and that&rsquo;s what I do already</li><li>So why is this better than being a very good student? Perhaps because of the domain specificity of doing well on exams.</li><li>A personal story of the author on how he started to specialise deeply in risk (small probability events, black swans&mldr;) and made a career out of it after just going down the rabbit hole and reading very voraciously, not in the structured way of schooling. Maybe the lesson here is that <strong>don&rsquo;t read or try to learn stuff with the explicit intention of getting something out of it</strong>&mldr;</li><li><em>What one needs to know for a profession is necessarily what lies outside the corpus, as far away from the centre as possible.</em> How to apply this to actuarial, when in the early years exams plays a central role to your career?

And some other seemingly important points like payoff being the most important thing. And that we decide based on fragility, not probability</li><li>The difference between <em>narrated, intelligible knowledge</em> vs the more <em>opaque kind entirely probed by tinkering.</em> It is incorrect to think that things always have a reason that we can understand easily<ul><li>The &lsquo;most severe mistake in life&rsquo;: mistaking the unintelligible for the unintelligent. i.e. <strong>What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent</strong> (<a class="internal-link broken">2_Nietzsche</a>). <strong>Mistaking what you don&rsquo;t see as non-existent</strong>, a sibling of <a class="internal-link broken">C_Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">C_Turkey problem</a><ul><li>The fragilista mistakes what he does not understand for nonsense</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">2_Socrates</a> and his questions&mldr; <a class="internal-link broken">C_Socratic Method</a>.

Yin and yang. &mldr;</li><li>&lsquo;Structured learning likes the impoverishment and simplification of naive rationalism, easy to teach, not the rich texture of empiricism&rsquo;.<ul><li>Ernest Renan: logic, by definition, excludes nuances, and since <em>truth resides exclusively in the nuances</em>, logic is a &lsquo;useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences&rsquo;</li></ul></li><li>&lsquo;Things are too complicated to be expressed in words&rsquo;. Another thing I heard before: you need the vocabulary of something to be useful to converse about it, or something like that. How to marry these 2 ideas together?</li><li>How the ancients saw <em>naive rationalism</em>: by impoverishing, rather than enhancing, thought, it introduces fragility.

But the counterpoint is that large-scale projects 150 years ago were completed on time, many even early (Empire State Building, Crystal Palace, etc.)</li><li>It was much a much more <em>linear</em> economy back then, less complex. Now we have more <em>nonlinearities</em>: asymmetries and convexities</li><li>&lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; and thee removal of buffers - people now sail too close to the wind. There are now many <em>bottlenecks</em> and thee project get as weak as the weakest link (negative convexity effect)</li><li>Therefore, it&rsquo;s not just a psychological problem of &lsquo;planning fallacy&rsquo;. It is just the nonlinear structure of projects; errors add to the right end.
