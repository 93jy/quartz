They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li><li><strong>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a <em>critical threshold</em>.</strong> The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.

This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: <strong>changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years</strong>. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, <strong>the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits</strong>. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.</li><li><em>Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight.</em> I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a <strong>gradual evolution</strong>, <strong>a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs</strong>. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.</li><li>The backbone of this book is my <strong>four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward</strong>—and the <strong>four laws of behavior change</strong> that evolve out of these steps.</li><li>It is so <strong>easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis</strong>. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</li><li>==Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement==. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.</li><li>==A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination==. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems <strong>insignificant in the moment</strong>, but <strong>over the span of moments</strong> that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. <strong>Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations</strong>.</li><li>It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. <strong>What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success</strong>. You should be far more concerned with your current <strong>trajectory</strong> than with your current <strong>results</strong>.</li><li>==Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits==<ul><li>Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.</li></ul></li><li>If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is <strong>follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line</strong>.<ul><li>Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.</li></ul></li><li>==Time magnifies the margin between success and failure==. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</li><li><strong>Habits are a double-edged sword</strong>. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.</li></ul><a href=#the-plateau-of-latent-potential><h4 id=the-plateau-of-latent-potential><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The plateau of latent potential</h4></a><ul><li>==Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change==.<ul><li>This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.</li></ul></li><li>Similarly, <strong>habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance</strong>. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a <strong>Valley of Disappointment</strong>. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a <strong>hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.</strong></li><li>If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the <strong>==Plateau of Latent Potential==</strong>. <em>Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</em></li><li><strong>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success</strong>. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—<em>when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress</em>—that makes the jump today possible.

Systems are about the <strong>processes</strong> that lead to those results.</li><li>Goals are good for setting a <strong>direction</strong>, but systems are best for <strong>making progress</strong></li><li>Problems with thinking too much about goals and not enough time <strong>designing your systems</strong><ul><li>==Winners and losers have the same goals==</li><li>Achieving a goal is only a <strong>momentary change</strong></li><li>Goals <strong>restrict your happiness</strong><ul><li>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that <strong>you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.</strong> For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax.</li><li>Furthermore, goals create an <strong>“either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment</strong>. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. <strong>It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success</strong>.</li><li>A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you <strong>don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running</strong>. And <strong>a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Goals are <strong>at odds with long term progress</strong><ul><li>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#a-system-of-atomic-habits><h4 id=a-system-of-atomic-habits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>A system of atomic habits</h4></a><ul><li>Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don&rsquo;t want to change, but because you have the <strong>wrong system</strong> for change</li><li>==You do not rise to the level of your goals.

How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)</h3></a><ul><li><strong>There are three levels of change</strong>: outcome change, process change, and identity change.</li><li>The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on <strong>who you wish to become.</strong></li><li><strong>Your identity emerges out of your habits</strong>. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</li><li><strong>Becoming the best version of yourself</strong> requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</li><li>The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can <strong>change your beliefs about yourself.</strong></li></ul><a href=#three-layers-of-behavior-change><h4 id=three-layers-of-behavior-change><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Three layers of behavior change</h4></a><ul><li>The 3 levels<ul><li>Changing your outcomes: like changing your results - losing weight, etc. Most goals associated with this level of change</li><li>Changing your process: changing your habits and systems - implementing new gym routine, developing meditation practice.

Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.</li><li>The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.</li><li>In short: <strong>genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity</strong>. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to <strong>direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability</strong>.</li><li>The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?” The first place we will look for an answer is by understanding your personality.</li></ul><a href=#how-your-personality-influences-your-habits><h4 id=how-your-personality-influences-your-habits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How your personality influences your habits</h4></a><ul><li>Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything.</li><li>The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the ==“<a class="internal-link broken">Big Five</a>,”== which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.<ol><li>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.</li><li>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easy going and spontaneous.</li><li>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).</li><li>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.</li><li>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.</li></ol></li><li>Build habits that <strong>work for your personality</strong>. You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.</li></ul><a href=#how-to-find-a-game-where-the-odds-are-in-your-favour><h4 id=how-to-find-a-game-where-the-odds-are-in-your-favour><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How to find a game where the odds are in your favour</h4></a><ul><li>In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, <strong>any area can become challenging</strong>. At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skillset.</li><li>The <strong>explore/exploit trade-off</strong></li><li>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent</li><li>The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. <strong>If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career— it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it</strong>. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.</li><li>Questions to continually ask<ul><li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</li><li>What makes me lose track of time? (<a class="internal-link broken">C_Flow</a>)</li><li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li><li>What comes naturally to me?</li></ul></li><li>We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.</li><li>When you can’t win by being better, you can <strong>win by being different</strong>. By <strong>combining</strong> your skills, you <strong>reduce the level of competition,</strong> which makes it <strong>easier to stand out</strong>. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by <strong>rewriting the rules</strong>. A good player works hard to win the game <em>everyone else is playing</em>. A great player ==creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses==.</li><li>Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you</li></ul><a href=#how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-genes><h4 id=how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-genes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How to get the most out of your genes</h4></a><ul><li>One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. <strong>Work hard on the things that come easy</strong>.</li></ul><a href=#19-the-goldilocks-rule-how-to-stay-motivated-in-life-and-work><h3 id=19-the-goldilocks-rule-how-to-stay-motivated-in-life-and-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>19.

Scientists have been studying this question for many years.

Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</li><li>Once a habit <strong>has been established</strong>, it’s important to continue to <strong>advance in small ways</strong>.

Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster than that. Hitting your habit a few times in a row and <em>letting one day slip doesn&rsquo;t feel like much</em>. Things are going well. It&rsquo;s <em>easy to rationalise taking a day off because you&rsquo;re in a good place</em>. <strong>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.</strong></li><li>&ldquo;Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly&rdquo;</li><li>The <strong>sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure</strong>: half of the time you get what you want.
