With the flick of a wrist Chinese history has utterly changed its complexion, much the way an actor in Sichuan opera swaps one mask for another. <strong>In the short space of thirty years, a China ruled by politics has transformed itself into a China where money is king</strong>.</li><li>&mldr; the political passions that had erupted in Tiananmen—political passions that had accumulated since the Cultural Revolution—had finally expended themselves completely in one fell swoop, <strong>to be replaced by a passion for getting rich</strong>. When everyone united in the urge to make money, the economic surge of the 1990s was the natural outcome.</li></ul><a href=#disparity-and-social-tensions><h3 id=disparity-and-social-tensions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disparity and social tensions</h3></a><ul><li>China today is a completely different story. So <strong>intense is the competition</strong> and so unbearable the pressure that, for many Chinese, survival is like war itself. In this social environment the strong prey on the weak, people enrich themselves through brute force and deception, and the meek and humble suffer while the bold and unscrupulous flourish. <strong>Changes in moral outlook and the reallocation of wealth have created a two-tiered society</strong>, and this in turn generates <strong>social tensions</strong>. So in China today there have emerged <strong>real classes and real class conflict.</strong></li></ul><a href=#on-reading><h3 id=on-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>On reading</h3></a><ul><li>If literature truly possesses a mysterious power, I think perhaps it is precisely this: that one can read a book by a writer of a different time, a different country, a different race, a different language, and a different culture and there <strong>encounter a sensation that is one’s very own</strong>.</li></ul><a href=#on-writing><h3 id=on-writing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>On writing</h3></a><ul><li>Years later young people often ask, “How does one become a writer?” My answer is always simply: <strong>“By writing.</strong>” Writing is <strong>like experience</strong>: if you don’t experience things, then you won’t understand life; and if you don’t write, then you won’t know what you’re capable of creating.</li><li>Writing tends to promote physical and psychological health, I feel, for it can make one’s life complete. To put it another way, writing enables me to claim ownership of two lives, one imaginary and one real, and the relationship between them is like that between sickness and health: when one is strong, the other is bound to fall into decline. So, as my real life becomes more routine, my imaginary life is all the more brimming with incident.</li></ul><a href=#revolutionary-instincts><h3 id=revolutionary-instincts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Revolutionary instincts</h3></a><ul><li>In China official seals are needed everywhere, all the time.</li><li>Behind the situation is a developmental model saturated with revolutionary violence of the Cultural Revolution type. To suppress popular discontent and resistance, some local governments send in large numbers of police to haul away any residents who refuse to budge. Then a dozen or more giant bulldozers will advance in formation, knocking down a blockful of old houses in no time at all. When the residents are finally released, they find only rubble where their homes once stood. Vagrants now, they have no option but to bow to reality and accept the housing offered.</li><li><strong>Our economic miracle—or should we say, the economic gain in which we so revel—relies to a significant extent on the <em>absolute authority of local governments</em>,</strong> for an administrative order on a piece of paper is all that’s required to implement drastic change. The method may be simple and crude, but the results in terms of economic development are instantaneous. That is why I say it is the lack of political transparency that has facilitated China’s breakneck growth.</li></ul><a href=#grassroots-ordinary-but-enterprising-citizens><h3 id=grassroots-ordinary-but-enterprising-citizens><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Grassroots (ordinary but enterprising citizens)</h3></a><ul><li>China’s economic miracle of the past thirty years, it’s fair to say, is an <strong>agglomeration of countless individual miracles created at the grassroots level</strong>. China’s grassroots dare to think and dare to act; in the tide of economic development they will adopt any method that suits their purposes, and they are bold enough to try things that are illegal or even criminal. At the same time China’s legal system has developed only slowly, <strong>leaving plenty of loopholes for the grassroots to exploit and putting all kinds of profits within their reach</strong>. Add to that their dauntless courage, which comes from their <strong>having nothing to lose</strong>, since they began with nothing at all.</li></ul><a href=#breakdown-in-the-moral-system><h3 id=breakdown-in-the-moral-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Breakdown in the moral system</h3></a><ul><li>The rapid rise in popularity of the word “bamboozle,” like that of “copycat,” demonstrates to me a <strong>breakdown of social morality and a confusion in the value system in China today</strong>; it is an <strong>aftereffect of our uneven development these past thirty years</strong>.</li><li>If anything, bamboozling is even more widespread in social terms than the copycat phenomenon, and when bamboozling gains such wide acceptance, it goes to show that we live in a frivolous society, one that doesn’t set much store by matters of principle.</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Books/ data-ctx="China in 10 Words" data-src=/notes/Books class=internal-link>Books</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by 93jy using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
