It is a <strong>simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask, ==what makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?==</strong>. In fact <strong>==it is the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer==</strong></li><li>&mldr; the recognition that <strong>a deep work habit requires you to ==treat your time with respect==</strong>. A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: <em><strong>Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday</strong></em>. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.</li></ul></blockquote><p>On intentionality of how you spend your time (even <strong>leisure</strong> time):</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin</strong>. <strong>Structured hobbies</strong> provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate <strong>specific actions with specific goals</strong> to fill your time. A set program of reading, à la Bennett, where you spend regular time each night making progress on a series of deliberately chosen books, is also a good option, as is, of course, exercise or the enjoyment of good (in-person) company.</li><li>If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, <strong>you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed</strong>, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in <strong>semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing</strong>.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#actionable-steps-from-part-2><h2 id=actionable-steps-from-part-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Actionable steps (from Part 2)</h2></a><a href=#b_deep-work-rule-1---work-deeplyrule-1-work-deeply><h3 id=b_deep-work-rule-1---work-deeplyrule-1-work-deeply><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Rule #1: Work deeply</a></h3></a><ul><li><strong>Decide on your depth philosophy</strong></li><li><strong>Ritualise</strong>: general questions for any effective ritual<ul><li><strong>Where you will work and for how long</strong></li><li><strong>How you will work once you start to work:</strong> rules and processes to keep efforts structured, e.g. ban on internet use, or <strong>metric</strong> like words produced</li><li><strong>How you will support your work:</strong> e.g. cup of good coffee, food, environmental factors</li></ul></li><li><strong>Make grand gestures</strong></li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t work alone</strong></li><li><strong>Execute like a business</strong> (tough part: executing the strategy) - 4DX framework from Christensen<ul><li><strong>Discipline #1: Focus on the wildly important</strong><ul><li>Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours</li><li>Have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discipline #2: Act on the lead measures</strong><ul><li>Fundamental premise of 4DX: <a class="internal-link broken">C_execution is more difficult than strategising</a></li><li>Lag measures too late; lead measures measure new behaviours that will drive success on lag measures</li><li>==Time spent in a state of deep work dedicated to your wildly important goal==</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discipline #3: Keep a compelling scoreboard</strong><ul><li>Also to calibrate expectations for number of hours of deep work needed per result</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discipline #4: Create a cadence of accountability</strong><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">C_Weekly, quarterly review and plan</a>: making a plan for the workweek ahead (see rule #4)</li><li>Celebrate good weeks, understand what led to bad weeks, how to ensure good score for days ahead</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Shutdown ritual</strong><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">3 reasons why downtime is so important</a><ul><li>Downtime aids insights</li><li>Downtime helps recharge energy needed to work deeply</li><li>The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important (debatable&mldr; You still need to do your admin tasks)</li></ul></li><li>Accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention</li><li>Every incomplete task, goal, project has been reviewed and for each, confirmed that either (1) there is a plan you trust for its completion, (2) it&rsquo;s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right</li><li>Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work.

These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</li><li>Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, <strong>logistical-style tasks</strong>, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</li><li>Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow (whether you think it’s philosophically good or bad) is <strong>exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity</strong> for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing <strong>depth</strong></li><li>Deep work is a skill that has great value today<ul><li>Learning: We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly. To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.</li><li>The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful, <strong>its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless</strong>—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is <strong>mediocre</strong>, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to <strong>find a better alternative online.</strong><ul><li>Whether you’re a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to hold his own in a hot start-up: To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Deep Work Hypothesis:</strong> The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly <strong>rare</strong> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly <strong>valuable</strong> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.</li><li>Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.</li></ul><a href=#b_deep-work-part-1---the-ideapart-1-the-idea><h2 id=b_deep-work-part-1---the-ideapart-1-the-idea><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Part 1: The Idea</a></h2></a><a href=#part-2-the-rules><h2 id=part-2-the-rules><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2: The Rules</h2></a><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">Rule #1: Work deeply</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Rule #2: Embrace boredom</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Rule #3: Quit social media</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Rule #4: Drain the shallows</a></li></ul><a href=#conclusion><h2 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h2></a><p>Deep work is way more powerful than most people understand.</p><p>The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. In Part 1, I quoted writer Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” I agree. So does Bill Gates. And hopefully now that you’ve finished this book, you agree too.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Books/ data-ctx="Deep Work" data-src=/notes/Books class=internal-link>Books</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by 93jy using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
