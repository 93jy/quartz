Outcomes did not matter; <strong>they were proven right by both successes and failures</strong>, and burrowed further into their ideas. It made them <strong>outstanding at predicting the past, but dart-throwing chimps at predicting the future</strong>.</li><li>The foxes, meanwhile, “draw from an eclectic array of traditions, and accept ambiguity and contradiction,” Tetlock wrote. Where hedgehogs represented narrowness, <strong>foxes</strong> ranged outside a single discipline or theory and embodied breadth.</li><li>In an impressively unsightly image, Tetlock described the very best forecasters as <strong>foxes with dragonfly eyes</strong>. Dragonfly eyes are composed of tens of thousands of lenses, each with a different perspective, which are then synthesized in the dragonfly’s brain.</li><li>Foxes see complexity in what others mistake for simple cause and effect.

Especially now, when all the information is on your phone. <strong>You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning</strong>.”</li><li>an official with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission learned I was writing about specialization and contacted me to make sure I knew that specialization had played a critical role in the 2008 global financial crisis. “Insurance regulators regulated insurance, bank regulators regulated banks, securities regulators regulated securities, and consumer regulators regulated consumers,” the official told me. <strong>“But the provision of credit goes across all those markets. So we specialized products, we specialized regulation, and the question is, ‘Who looks across those markets?’ The specialized approach to regulation missed ==systemic issues.==”</strong></li><li>The interface between specialties, and between creators with disparate backgrounds, has been studied, and it is worth defending.</li><li>work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then <strong>more likely in the long run to be a smash hit</strong> in the library of human knowledge.</li><li>“I always advise my people to ==<strong>read outside your field, everyday something</strong>==. And most people say, ‘Well, I don’t have time to read outside my field.’ I say, ‘No, you do have time, it’s far more important.’ ==Your world becomes a bigger world, and maybe there’s a moment in which you make connections.”==</li><li><strong>At its core, all hyperspecialization is a well-meaning drive for efficiency</strong>—the most efficient way to develop a sports skill, assemble a product, learn to play an instrument, or work on a new technology. But <strong>inefficiency needs cultivating too</strong>. The wisdom of a Polgar-like method of laser-focused, efficient development is limited to narrowly constructed, kind learning environments.</li></ul><a href=#conclusion-expanding-your-range><h4 id=conclusion-expanding-your-range><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONCLUSION: Expanding your range</h4></a><ul><li>==Wicked problems: you must tolerate the highest highs and the lowest lows. Learn and adjust as you go, and even abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely if needed.

When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four.” In the wider world, “every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.” It doesn’t mean breakthrough creation is luck, although that helps, but rather that it is hard and inconsistent. <strong>Going where no one has is a wicked problem. There is no well-defined formula or perfect system of feedback to follow. It’s like the stock market that way; if you want the sky highs, you have to tolerate a lot of lows.</strong></li><li>Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to <strong>learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely</strong> should the need arise.</li><li>Finally, remember that <strong>there is nothing inherently wrong with specialization</strong>. We all specialize to one degree or another, at some point or other. My initial spark of interest in this topic came from reading viral articles and watching conference keynotes that offered early hyperspecialization as some sort of life hack, a prescription that will save you the wasted time of diverse experience and experimentation. I hope I have added ideas to that discussion, because research in myriad areas suggests that ==mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated==. As Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a century ago, of the free exchange of ideas, “It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.”</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Books/ data-ctx="Range (book)" data-src=/notes/Books class=internal-link>Books</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by 93jy using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
