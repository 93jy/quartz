And, <em>stop thinking what the job can do for you, but what you can do for the job / how to be useful</em>. And don&rsquo;t need to plan so closely what you want to be in your career, just focus on accruing the capital and the skills (with the documentation / intentionality&mldr;) and you will eventually get somewhere, with <em>patience</em> too.</li><li><strong>Deliberate practice</strong> - on paper sounds like a good idea, and can implement the time tracking (toggl) to be more <em>intentional</em> with time. But beyond that, the concepts of &lsquo;stretching abilities&rsquo; and &lsquo;feedback&rsquo; are quite fuzzy and may not be so easy to implement in a real work setting?</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#intro><h5 id=intro><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Intro</h5></a><ul><li>Different approaches to thinking about work: the <strong>craftsman</strong> mindset, a focus on what <strong>value <em>you’re</em> producing</strong> in your job, and the <strong>passion</strong> mindset, a focus on what <strong>value <em>your</em> job offers you</strong>. Most people adopt the passion mindset, but I argue that the craftsman mindset is the <strong>foundation for creating work you love.</strong></li><li><strong>Hour tracking strategy</strong>: Newport tracks the hours spent doing deep work on research problem&mldr; Turning his attention back to the quality of what he produces</li><li>What&rsquo;s bad about the <strong>passion mindset</strong><ul><li>Focusing only on what the work offers you makes you hyperaware of what you don&rsquo;t like about it, leading to unhappiness</li><li>More importantly, the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are <em>essentially impossible to confirm</em>. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to <em>keep you perpetually unhappy and confused</em>, which probably explains why Bronson admits, not long into his career-seeker epic What Should I Do With My Life? that “the one feeling everyone in this book has experienced is of missing out on life.”</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centred concerns about whether your job is &lsquo;just right&rsquo;, and instead put your head down and plug away at <em>getting really damn good</em>. <strong>No one owes you a great career, you need to earn it</strong>, and the process won&rsquo;t be easy.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Put aside whether your job is your true passion, instead turn your focus toward being so good they can&rsquo;t ignore you.</li><li>Jordan had a name for the worries about <em>what his friends are doing with their lives and whether his accomplishments compare favorably</em>: <strong>“the cloud of external distractions.”</strong> Fighting this cloud is an ongoing battle. Along these lines, Steve Martin was so unsure during his decade-long dedication to improving his routine that he regularly suffered crippling anxiety attacks.<ul><li>The source of these performers’ craftsman mindset is not some unquestionable inner passion, but instead something more pragmatic: It’s what works in the entertainment business. As Mark Casstevens put it, “the tape doesn’t lie”: If you’re a guitar player or a comedian, what you produce is basically all that matters. If you spend too much time focusing on whether or not you’ve found your true calling, the question will be rendered moot when you find yourself out of work.</li><li>This is relatable&mldr; basically fomo about what other people are doing in other seemingly more interesting industries, earning more than you, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#the-career-capital-theory-of-great-work><h5 id=the-career-capital-theory-of-great-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The career capital theory of great work</h5></a><ul><li>The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.</li><li>Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your <strong>career capital</strong>.</li><li>The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a <em>strategy well suited for acquiring career capital</em>. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.</li><li>You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the <strong>craftsman</strong> mindset is focused on achieving exactly that goal.</li><li>The downside of the <strong>passion</strong> mindset is that it strips away merit. For passion proponents like Slim, launching a freelance career that gives you control, creativity, and impact is easy—it’s just the act of getting started that trips us up. <em>Career capital theory disagrees. It tells us that great work doesn’t just require great courage, but also skills of great (and real) value</em>. When Feuer left her advertising career to start a yoga studio, not only did she discard the career capital acquired over many years in the marketing industry, but she transitioned into an unrelated field where she had almost no capital.</li></ul><a href=#three-disqualifiers-for-applying-the-craftsman-mindset><h5 id=three-disqualifiers-for-applying-the-craftsman-mindset><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET</h5></a><ul><li>The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by <strong>developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable</strong>.<ul><li>Actuarial: it is a deep and technical field so this is not a concern</li></ul></li><li>The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.<ul><li>Arguably so, but this is justifiable in any number of ways lol. &lsquo;Bullshit Jobs&rsquo;</li></ul></li><li>The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.<ul><li>Not currently, but things could change quickly</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#not-having-elaborate-plans-for-your-career-mike-jackson><h5 id=not-having-elaborate-plans-for-your-career-mike-jackson><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Not having elaborate plans for your career: Mike Jackson</h5></a><ul><li>He leveraged the craftsman mindset to do whatever he did really well, ensuring that <strong>he came away from each experience with as much career capital as possible</strong>.

At the end of every week he <strong>prints his numbers to see how well he achieved this goal, and then uses this feedback to guide himself in the week ahead</strong>. The fact that he’s been promoted three times in less than three years underscores the effectiveness of this deliberate approach. → maybe I should be even more neurotic about my toggl time tracking??</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#the-5-habits-of-a-craftsman><h5 id=the-5-habits-of-a-craftsman><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The 5 habits of a craftsman</h5></a><ul><li>Step 1: Decide the type of career capital market you&rsquo;re in: winner-takes-all vs auction.
