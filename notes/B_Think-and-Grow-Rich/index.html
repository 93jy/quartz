But this book keeps talking about having a fixed $ target in your mind and to let that seep into your subconscious. The unabashed pursuit of money seems a bit crass and makes me uncomfortable. How can I go to bed each night saying aloud &lsquo;I will have $xx million by 20xx&rsquo; LOL.

The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as the outer guard to the approach of the subconscious.</li></ul></li><li>You must communicate the object of your desire directly to your subconscious mind in a spirit of absolute <strong>faith</strong>. Your subconscious mind recognises and acts <em>only upon thoughts that have been well mixed with <strong>emotion or feeling</strong></em>. Plain, unemotional words do <em>not</em> influence the subconscious mind. The words must be well emotionalised with <strong>belief</strong>.</li><li>You must be able to concentrate upon a given <em>desire</em> until that desire becomes a <em>burning obsession</em></li><li><strong>Do not wait for a definite plan</strong> through which you can earn the money. Begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, <em>demanding and expecting</em> meanwhile that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan. When they arrive, this inspiration may be considered a direct message from Infinite Intelligence.</li><li><strong>Faith is the strongest and most productive of the emotions. Have the faith of a child.</strong></li><li>Some extreme instructions on reciting the thing you want right before bed and having the faith that it would come true someday (p74)</li><li>[In caps] <em>Read the entire chapter aloud once every night, until you become thoroughly convinced that the principle of autosuggestion is sound, that it will accomplish for you all that has been claimed for it</em></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/notes/B_The-Practice-of-Groundedness/ data-ctx="Think and Grow Rich" data-src=/notes/B_The-Practice-of-Groundedness class=internal-link>The Practice of Groundedness</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by 93jy using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://93jy.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
