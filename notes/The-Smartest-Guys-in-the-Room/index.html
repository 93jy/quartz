Boardroom battles, takeover bids, cozying up with important people politicians. A whole different world.<ul><li>Learning a bit more about the natural gas business, with parallels to the insurance industry.</li></ul></li><li>2022.06.28 p66 ECT was short on cash (their profits were all paper profits anyway), and Enron didn&rsquo;t want to inject more capital as it wanted ECT to be self-funding. It started <strong>securitisation</strong> of loans, &ldquo;removes capital and balance sheets as constraints for growth&rdquo;. How does that actually work?<ul><li>&lsquo;Cactus&rsquo; deal: $900m debt promised to gas producers sold to investors, who then sell the gas back to Enron, and Enron would sell to gas producers&mldr; Then debt eliminated from Enron&rsquo;s BS, and ECT gets cash (to accelerate growth)?</li></ul></li><li>p71 competition between Mark and Skilling because they had similar backgrounds; <a href=/quartz/notes/C_The-greatest-killer-of-happiness-is-comparison rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/C_The-greatest-killer-of-happiness-is-comparison>C_The greatest killer of happiness is comparison</a>. Not exactly related, but comparisons are more painful when you compare against e.g. your highschool classmates, people (once) similar to you</li><li>p74 <a class="internal-link broken">C_Greater fool theory</a></li><li>p76: &rsquo;no one felt responsible for managing the projects after they were up and running. They saw their role as getting the deal done&rsquo; - cautionary tale for our team, the monitoring / valuation aspect is also important, to maintain the IF book going forward</li><li>2022.06.29 p78 <strong><a href=/quartz/notes/2_Incentives rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/2_Incentives>C_Incentives</a></strong> Drove a lot of the destructive behaviour, e.g. the dealmakers were incentivised by the deals rather than the follow-up. &ldquo;Fatal flaw&rdquo; was thee compensation structure.<ul><li>PVCF (similar to VNB!) was the metric. They were paid when the banks lent money, not when the project was executed</li></ul></li><li>2022.07.01 p88: Government backed financing for development projects</li><li>2022.07.02 p91: Visionaries vs deep down operators (Lay vs Kinder): &ldquo;there are lots of visionaries, but <em>very few people who can actually run a company</em>&rdquo;<ul><li>Kinder was also the only one at the top who <em>looked skeptically at things</em>, consistently asking &lsquo;are we smoking our own dope? Are we drinking our own whiskey?&rsquo;</li></ul></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Growth stocks</a>: the only kind of stocks investors wanted to buy in the bull run of 1990s (companies that EPS grow at double digit rates)<ul><li>When a growth company doesn&rsquo;t meet the aggressive target, the punishment is usually severe. <em>On the up it&rsquo;s great, but can spiral equally quickly on the downside</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Earnings volatility</strong>: the way companies normally work, but they&rsquo;re <em>not rewarded by Wall Street, which values consistency above all else</em>.</li><li>p101: Jeff Skilling had little appreciation for how one got things done in the real world; he had little interest in the nuts and bolts of operations (still a management consultant at heart). That&rsquo;s always important&mldr; My current role (MR) shows me the detailed technical stuff (the operational considerations in treaties) and also the bigger picture thinking (business concepts and etc)</li><li>p102: &lsquo;Quality of earnings&rsquo;: Wall St started questioning how Enron managed to hit its earnings targets</li><li>P102: <em>good on the way up, terrible on the way down</em> (like <a class="internal-link broken">00_Crypto</a>): when investors love a stock, they&rsquo;ll <em>forgive a lot</em>, and gloss over potential problems. But once Wall Street goes negative on a stock, the opposite takes place: a remorseless skepticism takes hold as investors search for clues that more bad news is on the way<ul><li>Downgrading of Enron stock to &lsquo;hold&rsquo; (Wall street&rsquo;s code for sell)</li></ul></li><li>p105 <a class="internal-link broken">Share buyback</a>: when a company buys back its own shares, this results in fewer shares outstanding, which improves the (closely watched) earnings per share number</li><li>p105: Skilling made Enron more like ECT, which meant creating new, modern businesses and de-emphasising old legacy operations like pipelines and natural gas production</li><li>His next big idea: trading other things, like electric power<ul><li>As thee first big entrant in the power-trading business, Enron could <em>create liquidity</em> and exploit big early profit margins from a young, inefficient market</li><li>Enron was an outsider to thee power business though</li><li>Big difference between the 2: electricity couldn&rsquo;t be stored unlike natural gas. So electricity prices were highly volatile (far more than natural gas). Volatility increased potential for big profits, and losses</li></ul></li><li>p110 Skilling vs Mark: Skilling believed Enron&rsquo;s future lay in his &lsquo;asset-light strategy&rsquo;, driven by brainpower, not physical infrastructure. Mark&rsquo;s division was nothing but hard assets</li><li>P114 <em>It is hard to think of a more important concept for Enron than managing risk</em>.<ul><li>Figuring out whether a deal was worth doing was nothing if not an exercise in calculating risk: did the returns justify the risk of all the things that could go wrong?</li><li>Skilling knew Wall Street wanted to see a strong system of internal controls and made the Risk Assessment and Control department a centrepiece of management presentations to Wall Street analysts</li><li>On paper, RAC sounded terrific (it did all the things that the RM department does&mldr; And gives its recommendation on whether to proceed with the deal)</li><li>&lsquo;RAC was a hurdle, speed bump, but not an obstacle. If a deal had overwhelming commercial support, it got done&rsquo; - very relatable, and ominous&mldr; Maybe we should treat Frank and RM questions with more respect</li><li>Person: CRO Rick Buy was a &lsquo;pleasant, paunchy man with glasses, a soft spoken sort, uncomfortable with confrontation&rsquo; - he couldn&rsquo;t stand up to the originators, deal makers. To be CRO must be ok with being the bad guy&mldr; Like Frank</li><li><em>It is business wisdom that many of a company&rsquo;s best deals are the ones it doesn&rsquo;t do</em>. But at Enron, the place was defined by dealmaking (sounds like my team?)</li><li>RAC existed to keep analysts happy</li><li>Putting a lot of pressure on the RAC to sign off by submitting deals close to the quarter end (that&rsquo;s probably why Frank says cannot strong-arm him and set these deadlines)</li><li>The CRO felt he was ineffective, but still wanted to stay because of the money and to wait for his stock options to invest&mldr; tough decision and explained by <a href=/quartz/notes/2_Incentives rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/2_Incentives>2_Incentives</a> Again</li></ul></li><li>A lot of Enron sounded great in theory, but the reality was something else entirely</li><li>p120: Company culture, and how everything was different and radical - also because it was the dawn of thee internet age, where there was &lsquo;complete suspension of healthy skepticism and disbelief, and brand new dot-coms could pose serious threats to big, established companies&rsquo;.</li><li>p126: thee company became mostly traders and deal makers, abandoning its original business model. But a company built around trading and dealmaking cannot possibly have steadily increasing returns.<ul><li>Goldman Sachs, widely viewed as the <em>best trading firm in the world</em>, has a low <a class="internal-link broken">Price earnings ratio</a> Never exceeding 20x. It doesn&rsquo;t even attempt to predict its earnings ahead of time; it can&rsquo;t</li></ul></li><li>p124: Mostly just accounting tricks to increase the earnings; changing assumptions that are very sensitive (long term pricing curve) and squeezing out profits from these areas (like recognising OVAC very liberally). Valuing their investments much higher than they actually are worth, and using fair value accounting, recognising the profits in the current quarter<ul><li>Basically, just kicking the can down the road by deferring problems to the next period to hit their current quarterly earnings target</li></ul></li><li>p132: When did Enron cross the line? The scandal grew out of a steady accumulation of habits and values and actions that began years before and finally spiralled out of control<ul><li>In the bull market, all companies did these kinds of semi-shady things that Enron did too</li><li>A new ethos in corporate America: <em>anything not blatantly illegal was therefore okay</em>.*<ul><li>Incentives: creative accountants were rewarded; complex financial structures to make their numbers look better (after Enron, &lsquo;creative&rsquo; became a bad word)</li><li>Securities that looked like equity on the balance sheet but for tax purposes could be treated like debt</li><li>Securitisations exploded: everything turned to securities to sell to the investing public (lotto winnings, proceeds from tobacco lawsuits)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>p133: Global Finance led by Fastow led them down the path of ruin<ul><li>To bridge the gap between reality of the business and the picture they wanted to present to the world</li><li>Off-balance sheet vehicles, complex financing structures and other complicated deals nobody can understand even today</li></ul></li><li>p136 Rules vs principles<ul><li>Securitisation was so complex and ripe for abuse, so there were hundreds of rules. Fastow was &lsquo;rules driven&rsquo; from day one, and did anything possible to accomplish his goals while following the precise letter of the rules, even if it meant violating their intent</li><li>He did not cross the line at Continental Bank because they were more risk averse, but at Enron</li><li>Maybe shows the importance of rules based vs principle-based, and why principle-based is probably better&mldr;</li></ul></li><li>p138 Fastow&rsquo;s unhappiness despite earning so much and climbing so fast: <a href=/quartz/notes/C_The-greatest-killer-of-happiness-is-comparison rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/C_The-greatest-killer-of-happiness-is-comparison>C_The greatest killer of happiness is comparison</a> - seeing how he will match the top earner salaries<ul><li>The finance department didn&rsquo;t have its own P&L (<em>P&L: meaning the division is more than a cost centre, it makes money for the company</em>). So he lobbied to have his own division</li></ul></li><li>p140: fear culture: people started to get fearful to speak out against Fastow with his volatile temper</li><li>p140: Fastow was the wrong person to be CFO (at 36 years old)<ul><li>He didn&rsquo;t have the knowledge base, his <em>skillset was narrow</em> - creating financial structures. He lacked the experience and judicious temperament the job required, the willingness to say no to deals, and attention to basics necessary to insure that the company&rsquo;s balance sheet remained strong. No risk control bone in his body</li><li>He didn&rsquo;t have the basic knowledge, hardly any accounting. A corporate finance asset-backed guy made CFO, doesn&rsquo;t make sense</li></ul></li><li>P 142 &lsquo;Absolute conviction at Enron that clever accounting could alter the business reality&rsquo;<ul><li>&lsquo;Rules creating opportunities to exploit weakness&rsquo;. Form over substance</li><li>They were actually proud of their rule-bending and gaming the system. <em>In their view, they were doing what every other company was doing, but better and smarter, because they were Enron, where everything was done better and smarter.
